<i>Previously on "The Whispers"...</i>

2
00:00:01,504 --> 00:00:03,403
- My head kind of hurts.
- Minx?

3
00:00:03,702 --> 00:00:06,904
As Drill is becoming
weaker, our kids are, too.

4
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:08,005
Isolate them?

5
00:00:08,056 --> 00:00:09,757
Drill said we'll all get better

6
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,676
as soon as he finds Orion.

7
00:00:11,727 --> 00:00:15,513
"Orion" could mean a person or a place.

8
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:17,648
Someone with access who could
help him send the signal.

9
00:00:17,683 --> 00:00:18,649
Is someone there?

10
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:20,101
Stay away!

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,321
It's a burn mark. Drill is here.

12
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:25,673
He's possessed one of the children.

13
00:00:25,707 --> 00:00:27,274
It could be any of them.

14
00:00:28,977 --> 00:00:30,778
Silas, do you know who Drill is?

15
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,781
It's Drill! I told you he'd know!

16
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,129
Daddy! Daddy!

17
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:51,432
It's okay, Minx.
It's all right. Daddy's here.

18
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:53,734
Okay, come here. It's okay.

19
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:56,670
It's okay. I got you. All right.

20
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:58,672
All right.

21
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:00,808
You okay?

22
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,443
Huh, what's wrong?

23
00:01:02,477 --> 00:01:03,744
I had a bad dream.

24
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:06,914
Well, you're awake now.

25
00:01:06,948 --> 00:01:08,716
I don't like being scared.

26
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,484
I know. I know.

27
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:14,622
But, you know, when I was little,

28
00:01:14,656 --> 00:01:15,923
I was afraid of the dark.

29
00:01:15,957 --> 00:01:17,408
- You were?
- I was.

30
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:21,195
But grandpop, he...He taught me something.

31
00:01:21,229 --> 00:01:23,230
You know that... you know
that song, "twinkle twinkle"?

32
00:01:23,232 --> 00:01:26,533
You remember?

33
00:01:26,535 --> 00:01:29,470
Well, it used to be a poem.

34
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:32,573
And he said that when I felt scared,

35
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:34,541
I should say the poem out loud,

36
00:01:34,543 --> 00:01:39,029
because it worked like magic and
all my fears would disappear.

37
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,414
I want to learn it.

38
00:01:40,465 --> 00:01:43,767
Are you sure? It's very powerful magic.

39
00:01:43,818 --> 00:01:48,372
Okay. Well, repeat after me.

40
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:51,642
Twinkle, twinkle.

41
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:52,776
Twinkle, twinkle.

42
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:53,961
Little star.

43
00:01:53,995 --> 00:01:55,078
Little star.

44
00:01:55,129 --> 00:01:56,797
How I wonder what you are.

45
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,400
How I wonder what you are.

46
00:02:00,435 --> 00:02:04,004
Up above the world so high...

47
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:08,141
like a diamond in the sky.

48
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:10,410
Like a diamond in the sky.

49
00:02:10,445 --> 00:02:13,046
When the blazing sun is gone.

50
00:02:13,048 --> 00:02:15,349
When the blazing sun is gone.

51
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:17,317
When he nothing shines upon.

52
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,252
When he nothing shines upon.

53
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:24,024
Then you shine your little light.

54
00:02:24,075 --> 00:02:26,877
Twinkle, twinkle in the night.

55
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:30,363
Then the traveler in the dark...

56
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:36,086
thanks you for your little spark.

57
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,207
He could not see which way to go...

58
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:43,660
If you did not twinkle so.

59
00:02:43,711 --> 00:02:45,912
I am telling you, there is no way that
Minx would have let this happen, sir.

60
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:49,140
Wes, over 50 people saw her
burn the president's daughter.

61
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:50,214
I'm very... I'm very
aware of the situation.

62
00:02:50,313 --> 00:02:51,397
It's the same burn mark

63
00:02:51,486 --> 00:02:54,253
that was found on
Dr. Benavidez, Thomas Harcourt.

64
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:55,421
How do you explain that?

65
00:02:55,472 --> 00:02:58,057
I don't know, but I... I know there's
another explanation for this.

66
00:02:58,092 --> 00:02:59,859
Yeah, one of these kids is inhabited...

67
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:00,993
not my daughter!

68
00:03:06,133 --> 00:03:07,900
Let me talk to her. I'll...

69
00:03:07,902 --> 00:03:11,037
Do you really think
you're an impartial judge?

70
00:03:14,091 --> 00:03:16,242
Claire.

71
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:17,610
- Please. Please.
- Wes, I can't.

72
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:19,779
- I can't do... I can't be the one.
- Okay, just... just go...

73
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:23,382
just go and ask her
what really happened, okay?

74
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:24,350
Please.

75
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:27,153
You're the only one I trust.

76
00:03:58,101 --> 00:04:00,386
You can leave.

77
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:17,369
Minx, I need to talk to you.

78
00:04:17,371 --> 00:04:20,372
If I can understand
what happened out there,

79
00:04:20,407 --> 00:04:24,710
what happened to Cassandra, I can help you.

80
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:29,098
You want me to prove I'm not Drill.

81
00:04:29,132 --> 00:04:30,115
Can you?

82
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,717
Well, if I was Drill,

83
00:04:31,719 --> 00:04:34,319
wouldn't I want to trick you
into thinking I'm not?

84
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:38,724
So...

85
00:04:38,726 --> 00:04:40,893
no matter what I do...

86
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:45,447
Besides...

87
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:46,999
why do I have to prove it?

88
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:50,736
Shouldn't you have to prove I'm guilty?

89
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:54,907
Why don't we try something?

90
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:58,944
I'm gonna take your gloves off.

91
00:04:58,962 --> 00:05:03,832
- You want me to touch you?
- Like you did Cassandra, yes.

92
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:09,254
But...

93
00:05:09,256 --> 00:05:11,173
Aren't you scared?

94
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:15,177
I'm trying not to be.

95
00:05:46,042 --> 00:05:48,160
I don't want to do this.

96
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:57,102
Okay.

97
00:05:59,472 --> 00:06:02,557
Okay. One more thing.

98
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:06,811
Can you tell me what Orion is?

99
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:09,397
I don't know...
you say you want to help me,

100
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:10,565
- but you keep asking me questions.
- I do want to help you.

101
00:06:10,616 --> 00:06:11,733
I do want to help you, Minx.

102
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:13,151
No, I don't believe you.

103
00:06:13,185 --> 00:06:14,319
Why would you say that?

104
00:06:14,321 --> 00:06:15,654
'Cause you don't like me.

105
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:17,489
- No, that is... that's not true.
- You want me to be guilty.

106
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:18,490
No.

107
00:06:18,524 --> 00:06:20,558
You want me to be Drill.

108
00:06:20,593 --> 00:06:23,561
'Cause then you get everything...

109
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:26,164
Don't you?

110
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:37,342
All I want right now...

111
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:39,511
is to find Drill.

112
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:44,716
Do you really think
it's gonna be that easy?

113
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:17,455
Synced and corrected by oykubuyuk
www.addic7ed.com

114
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:21,710
So, Dr. Benavidez told you about Drill?

115
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,293
Not exactly.

116
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:25,963
See, she was frightened...
couldn't give me the full story.

117
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:28,632
That's how it usually works
with whistle-blowers.

118
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,000
They give you a bread crumb

119
00:07:30,002 --> 00:07:32,503
and hope you find the truth
and leave them out of it.

120
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:34,638
- What's the bread crumb?
- Harbor Point.

121
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:36,890
She told me to dig into the real story.

122
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:38,575
That's when I learned about the meltdown,

123
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,246
what happened afterwards,
and how Drill was responsible.

124
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,931
So you know what Drill is.

125
00:07:43,982 --> 00:07:46,433
As far as I can tell,

126
00:07:46,484 --> 00:07:48,685
it's a secret government
nuclear-testing program.

127
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:52,522
Now, whether Drill is
an acronym or a code name...

128
00:07:52,524 --> 00:07:53,824
I'm still working on that one.

129
00:07:53,858 --> 00:07:56,693
But that night, at Harbor Point,
something went wrong,

130
00:07:56,695 --> 00:07:59,196
and children in the surrounding
area started getting sick,

131
00:07:59,247 --> 00:08:00,414
including your son.

132
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:02,082
So in order to contain the situation

133
00:08:02,116 --> 00:08:03,917
and keep the truth from getting out,

134
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:06,420
our government issued a round-up.

135
00:08:06,454 --> 00:08:08,422
Now 87 children are locked up

136
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:10,290
with no hope of ever getting out.

137
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,378
I just need confirmation.

138
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,179
I think we're done here.

139
00:08:18,549 --> 00:08:20,217
Just give me something.

140
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:23,887
The public, they have a right
to know what's really happening.

141
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:32,529
You think you're gonna be
able to hide this much longer?

142
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:36,483
Other news outlets, they're
already chasing the story.

143
00:08:36,534 --> 00:08:38,485
Please.

144
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:43,406
Wait.

145
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:47,811
He's right.

146
00:08:47,845 --> 00:08:49,462
It's just a matter of time.

147
00:08:49,497 --> 00:08:52,415
How about we make a deal?

148
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:54,417
You help me get what I want,

149
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:56,803
I'll give you the
biggest story of your life.

150
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:01,641
Henry.

151
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:06,196
I need to ask you something.

152
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:11,718
It's about Minx, isn't it?

153
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,186
You were right there.

154
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,773
You saw what happened.

155
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,441
I don't want to get Minx in trouble.

156
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:20,076
Neither do I.

157
00:09:20,111 --> 00:09:22,545
But right now, we really
need to know the truth.

158
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,499
She...

159
00:09:28,385 --> 00:09:29,953
She grabbed Cassandra.

160
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:32,672
And you're sure about this?

161
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:38,311
'Cause, Henry, I need you to be
100% sure that it was Minx.

162
00:09:44,968 --> 00:09:48,321
Silas, walk us through that night...

163
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:52,208
the night that you saw
Dr. Benavidez get killed.

164
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,477
Can you do that?

165
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,132
Okay.

166
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:01,083
What were you doing out here
so late at night?

167
00:10:03,253 --> 00:10:05,805
I had to go to the bathroom...

168
00:10:10,394 --> 00:10:12,428
but I got lost.

169
00:10:16,099 --> 00:10:18,951
There was a light from one of the offices.

170
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:23,856
She was talking on the phone... the doctor.

171
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:26,008
What was she saying? Do you remember?

172
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:29,395
I don't remember the words,
but she sounded worried.

173
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,197
It doesn't make any sense.

174
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:34,216
She saw something bad
on the computer, I think.

175
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,686
Then what happened?

176
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:39,288
There was a sound. It came from there.

177
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,459
Someone was there, but I couldn't see who.

178
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:48,697
So the doctor,
I think she saw who was there,

179
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,650
who was at the door, and...

180
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:53,953
Silas, it's okay.

181
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,121
It's okay.

182
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:58,557
There was this funny noise, like... A zap.

183
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:01,043
No. No.

184
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,661
Stay away!

185
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:05,464
The doctor... she fell down.

186
00:11:05,515 --> 00:11:07,182
She stopped moving.

187
00:11:07,184 --> 00:11:08,984
And you saw who it was, didn't you?

188
00:11:10,287 --> 00:11:12,254
She didn't see me at first.

189
00:11:12,289 --> 00:11:13,806
I tried to get away.

190
00:11:15,392 --> 00:11:16,609
Then she saw me.

191
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:21,780
She said she was going to kill my mom.

192
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:27,453
She said if I told anyone...

193
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:29,455
- Is my mom okay?
- Yes.

194
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:32,291
Yes.

195
00:11:32,342 --> 00:11:34,209
She's okay.

196
00:11:34,211 --> 00:11:38,714
I need to know if you're sure...

197
00:11:38,716 --> 00:11:40,799
It was Minx that you saw.

198
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,887
It was her. I swear.

199
00:11:53,322 --> 00:11:54,472
We have something.

200
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:56,452
We were able to recover

201
00:11:56,457 --> 00:11:58,975
partial fragments
of Dr. Benavidez's hard drive.

202
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,860
Here's the activity log from that night.

203
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:05,332
At 11:06 P.M., she made an
entry into a notes field.

204
00:12:05,383 --> 00:12:06,466
At the same time,

205
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:08,435
she was talking to an unidentified number.

206
00:12:08,486 --> 00:12:11,588
- No trace yet of who she was talking to?
- Not yet, sir.

207
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:14,507
But at 11:09 P.M.,
her call was disconnected.

208
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:18,862
The next activity... 12:28 A.M.

209
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:20,997
That's after her time of death.

210
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:22,799
Someone accessed that same file,

211
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,101
somehow bypassing her security password.

212
00:12:25,136 --> 00:12:27,070
They then erased
the last note that was made.

213
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,455
Any way to recover the note?

214
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:29,756
Unfortunately not.

215
00:12:29,807 --> 00:12:34,077
But I was able to determine
which file was modified.

216
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,715
Millicent?

217
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:41,384
That's Minx's real name.

218
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,310
Drill was covering his tracks.

219
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:52,295
The doctor must have found
some kind of evidence

220
00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:55,214
that proved Minx is Drill.

221
00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:59,636
That'll be all for now.

222
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,646
I believe I have what I need now.

223
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:14,584
But since Wes has asked for
your input, Agent Bennigan...

224
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:16,586
What's your professional opinion?

225
00:13:19,406 --> 00:13:21,224
Wes...

226
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:24,327
It isn't just the burn mark.

227
00:13:24,361 --> 00:13:27,680
Silas... he knew details
that he could have only known

228
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:29,315
if he was actually there,
and you heard his voice...

229
00:13:29,349 --> 00:13:30,670
a child his age can't
fake that kind of fear.

230
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:31,641
Okay, so he saw something...

231
00:13:31,668 --> 00:13:33,085
We both know that witnesses...

232
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,887
and Minx's file, if something was erased...

233
00:13:33,912 --> 00:13:38,407
We don't know... We don't know
what was in that file, Claire.

234
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:41,661
All I can do...

235
00:13:41,712 --> 00:13:45,598
is look at this like you and I
have been trained to do.

236
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:46,766
I wish... I wish...

237
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:51,202
more than anything that I could conclude

238
00:13:51,227 --> 00:13:52,755
- something else.
- Claire. Claire. Claire.

239
00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:55,558
Please.

240
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:00,763
Please.

241
00:14:08,622 --> 00:14:10,055
I'm sorry.

242
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,025
Okay.

243
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,852
Thank you, Agent Bennigan.

244
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:04,726
- What are you doing?
- Jessup, he's right.

245
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:08,914
The truth is gonna come out...
maybe not today, but soon.

246
00:15:08,965 --> 00:15:10,399
Let's make this work for us.

247
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:11,850
Us?

248
00:15:11,935 --> 00:15:13,268
And how exactly does that work?

249
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,770
Reporters have to fact-check, right?

250
00:15:14,772 --> 00:15:16,104
Meaning?

251
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:17,756
Meaning I tell him everything
that's really going on

252
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,174
with the kids, with Drill.

253
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,343
His first call's gonna be to
the White House

254
00:15:21,377 --> 00:15:22,644
for confirmation.

255
00:15:22,695 --> 00:15:24,363
After that...

256
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:25,514
Pressure's on.

257
00:15:25,548 --> 00:15:26,915
They're gonna have to release the kids,

258
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:28,800
or they're gonna have to deal
with the backlash of the public.

259
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:29,851
You mean panic.

260
00:15:29,902 --> 00:15:31,853
'Cause that's what
we're talking about here.

261
00:15:31,855 --> 00:15:33,355
It's only a matter of time.

262
00:15:33,406 --> 00:15:35,290
Time is something that I do not have.

263
00:15:35,292 --> 00:15:37,759
I want my son home now.

264
00:15:44,467 --> 00:15:46,001
- I want those removed.
- I'm sorry, sir.

265
00:15:46,003 --> 00:15:47,803
I have my orders. This is ridiculous!
She is a child!

266
00:15:47,837 --> 00:15:48,854
Come on.

267
00:15:48,905 --> 00:15:50,021
Sir! Sir!

268
00:15:50,073 --> 00:15:51,239
No, stop!

269
00:15:51,274 --> 00:15:54,209
I'll have no choice but to escort you out.

270
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,510
Do you understand?

271
00:15:55,545 --> 00:15:57,312
Yes.

272
00:15:57,346 --> 00:15:58,313
10 minutes.

273
00:15:58,364 --> 00:16:01,249
That's what you've been cleared for.

274
00:16:04,587 --> 00:16:05,754
Hey.

275
00:16:05,805 --> 00:16:07,455
Hey.

276
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,191
You okay, sweetie?

277
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,410
You have to get me out, daddy.

278
00:16:12,461 --> 00:16:14,296
Honey, I just need
a little more time, okay?

279
00:16:14,298 --> 00:16:16,231
- How much time?
- All right?

280
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:19,918
I know they're gonna do something to me.

281
00:16:19,952 --> 00:16:23,004
Sweetie, I will not let them hurt you.

282
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,339
I promise, okay?

283
00:16:24,373 --> 00:16:26,641
All right?

284
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:30,412
I'm scared.

285
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,746
I know.

286
00:16:31,748 --> 00:16:36,267
But you and I... we just need
to be brave right now, okay?

287
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,978
Okay, baby. It's all right.

288
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,750
Alright?

289
00:16:55,554 --> 00:16:57,805
Hey. I understand.

290
00:16:57,857 --> 00:17:01,693
It's okay.

291
00:17:01,744 --> 00:17:04,612
Hey.

292
00:17:04,614 --> 00:17:06,547
Do you remember, uh...

293
00:17:06,582 --> 00:17:09,601
You remember when... When you were little

294
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:13,788
and we used to... We used to say that poem,

295
00:17:13,822 --> 00:17:16,991
the one that would make
our fears magically go away?

296
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:18,459
You used to know it by heart.

297
00:17:18,461 --> 00:17:20,795
Twinkle, twinkle, little star...
You remember?

298
00:17:20,846 --> 00:17:21,846
Huh?

299
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,919
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

300
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,338
How I wonder what you are.

301
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:32,390
All right?

302
00:17:32,424 --> 00:17:34,308
Up above the world so high.

303
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:38,830
Like a diamond in the sky.

304
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:42,717
When the blazing sun is gone,
when he nothing shines upon.

305
00:17:42,768 --> 00:17:44,719
Minx, say the words, honey.

306
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,220
- No.
- Hey, I need you to...

307
00:17:46,271 --> 00:17:47,388
I don't want to do this.

308
00:17:47,422 --> 00:17:49,240
Okay, then you shine your little light

309
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,791
twinkle, twinkle all the night.

310
00:17:50,842 --> 00:17:51,843
Okay?

311
00:17:51,877 --> 00:17:54,128
You're testing me.

312
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:55,463
Baby, it's just...

313
00:17:56,632 --> 00:17:58,282
I can't... I can't think of
the words right now.

314
00:17:58,317 --> 00:18:00,534
My brain's fuzzy.

315
00:18:07,175 --> 00:18:10,361
Daddy. Daddy, please.

316
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:15,416
- It's okay.
- Daddy, please.

317
00:18:15,467 --> 00:18:16,417
It's okay.

318
00:18:16,468 --> 00:18:18,052
No.

319
00:18:18,086 --> 00:18:20,938
It's okay.

320
00:18:25,744 --> 00:18:28,212
It's okay, sweetheart.

321
00:18:28,246 --> 00:18:29,880
You don't have to say the words.

322
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:34,602
You're my dad.
You're supposed to believe me.

323
00:19:54,345 --> 00:19:56,229
Why didn't Minx tell us
she was Drill all along?

324
00:19:56,231 --> 00:19:58,331
- They've me these questions all day.
- Why can't I just go home?

325
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,833
We shared all our secrets together.

326
00:19:59,835 --> 00:20:01,468
I don't know what to tell them.
Drill is just our friend.

327
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,353
I don't know what I did wrong.

328
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:14,047
Henry?

329
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:20,119
Are you there?

330
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:28,485
It's Minx. Can you hear me?

331
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,553
Yeah.

332
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:37,094
I need your help.

333
00:20:37,128 --> 00:20:40,297
You need to talk to your mom,
tell her I'm not Drill.

334
00:20:40,331 --> 00:20:41,598
Uh, I don't know.

335
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:45,202
I swear, Henry, I'm not Drill.
You have to help me.

336
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:47,004
Please.

337
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,772
Do you know what they're gonna do to me?

338
00:20:50,975 --> 00:20:54,778
Aren't you my friend, Henry?

339
00:20:56,081 --> 00:20:58,248
Henry, why aren't you answering me?

340
00:20:58,283 --> 00:21:00,684
They're gonna kill her, Claire.

341
00:21:00,735 --> 00:21:02,986
She's my daughter.
I cannot let that happen.

342
00:21:02,988 --> 00:21:03,954
Wes, that's not Minx.

343
00:21:04,005 --> 00:21:05,255
Even if you're right

344
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:07,007
and Drill has taken possession of her,

345
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,392
that doesn't mean she's gone.

346
00:21:08,426 --> 00:21:11,745
What if, somewhere inside her
body, my daughter's still alive?

347
00:21:11,796 --> 00:21:13,096
Thomas Harcourt said that when...

348
00:21:13,131 --> 00:21:14,631
Thomas was 8 years old when it happened.

349
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:16,983
What if he was wrong?
And what if he wasn't?

350
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:19,836
Wes, we already missed our
chance to end this once before.

351
00:21:19,871 --> 00:21:21,338
Yes, and my wife was killed,

352
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,973
so I am well aware of
the consequences, Claire.

353
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:27,077
Minx...

354
00:21:27,128 --> 00:21:28,545
Is all I have left.

355
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,798
If I lose her...

356
00:21:31,849 --> 00:21:33,884
So I need you to look at me

357
00:21:33,886 --> 00:21:36,903
and tell me that
you are certain she has gone.

358
00:21:36,954 --> 00:21:38,705
That is not fair.

359
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,841
Look at me in the eye
and tell me she's dead,

360
00:21:40,892 --> 00:21:43,360
that the promise that I made to her when
she was a little girl means nothing

361
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:46,279
and that there is no hope
that I will ever get her back.

362
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:48,165
And then...

363
00:21:48,199 --> 00:21:50,133
Then I will believe you.

364
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:55,872
Sir, we have good news.

365
00:21:55,923 --> 00:22:00,310
We now know which of
the children has been possessed.

366
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:02,195
Who?

367
00:22:02,246 --> 00:22:05,048
It's Wes Lawrence's daughter.

368
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:09,235
I know. It's unfortunate.

369
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,737
My daughter, she's...

370
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,872
Perfectly fine.

371
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:16,259
The other children,
they're... they're all safe.

372
00:22:16,261 --> 00:22:18,511
So we could release them, then.

373
00:22:18,562 --> 00:22:20,196
With all due respect, uh,

374
00:22:20,198 --> 00:22:23,900
we don't know how much influence
he still has over them.

375
00:22:23,934 --> 00:22:26,102
Right now, the most prudent
course of action

376
00:22:26,137 --> 00:22:27,654
is to keep them all locked up

377
00:22:27,688 --> 00:22:30,406
until we know for sure
Drill has been neutralized.

378
00:22:30,424 --> 00:22:32,876
Yes.

379
00:22:34,379 --> 00:22:37,313
I know I made the wrong call, Haley.

380
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:41,167
Excuse me?

381
00:22:41,202 --> 00:22:43,803
I shouldn't have let him go.

382
00:22:43,854 --> 00:22:47,290
I know that now.

383
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,844
This time, we'll make the right decision.

384
00:22:51,896 --> 00:22:55,365
The questions is, how?

385
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:57,700
I believe we actually have
the perfect weapon

386
00:22:57,735 --> 00:22:58,901
to accomplish our task.

387
00:22:58,936 --> 00:23:00,803
Three months ago,

388
00:23:00,805 --> 00:23:03,606
I was sent to the Arctic
to test an experimental weapon.

389
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,744
It was an electron-pulse device
designed to emit

390
00:23:07,746 --> 00:23:10,797
an electrical charge equivalent
to 100 lightning strikes.

391
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:14,367
Unfortunately...
Things didn't go as planned.

392
00:23:14,401 --> 00:23:17,854
We brought him to us.

393
00:23:17,888 --> 00:23:21,340
He saw the energy, and he came right at me.

394
00:23:21,391 --> 00:23:22,992
"He"?

395
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:27,497
When I saw that blue light...

396
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:30,833
That was when I knew
that something was here.

397
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,469
"Something"?

398
00:23:33,504 --> 00:23:35,438
Something not human.

399
00:23:35,472 --> 00:23:37,406
I just need more time.

400
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:38,958
Where are the guards?

401
00:23:38,992 --> 00:23:39,992
Oh, God.

402
00:23:42,246 --> 00:23:44,347
No!

403
00:23:44,398 --> 00:23:45,598
I'm sorry, Wes.

404
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:47,566
- Where is she?!
- You have to believe me.

405
00:23:47,618 --> 00:23:49,619
I take no solace in what needs to be done.
Sir, you don't have to do this now.

406
00:23:49,621 --> 00:23:51,587
- I just need a few more days, so...
- To what?

407
00:23:51,622 --> 00:23:52,922
T... To remove Drill from her body.

408
00:23:52,924 --> 00:23:54,340
So now you're talking about exorcism?

409
00:23:54,424 --> 00:23:55,591
- Listen to yourself.
- Sir...

410
00:23:55,593 --> 00:23:57,259
No more negotiations, Wes. Please.

411
00:23:57,294 --> 00:23:59,061
We're going to end this today.

412
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,446
No, no. I'm sorry, sir.

413
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,947
- It's best if you weren't here for this.
- Sir, sir.

414
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,199
- Please, you can't... you can't do this.
- Please, escort them out.

415
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,200
You can't do this.
She is an 8-year-old child!

416
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,736
Mr. Secretary, please, give us...

417
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,387
Damn it!

418
00:24:08,422 --> 00:24:11,857
Talking about using this thing on a child?

419
00:24:11,892 --> 00:24:15,444
It's not a child, sir.
It's an alien threat.

420
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:26,455
Do it. Just get it over with.

421
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:27,973
I'm not leaving here!

422
00:24:31,945 --> 00:24:33,112
Get off me!

423
00:24:35,532 --> 00:24:37,399
Wes. Wes, Wes, Wes, Wes.

424
00:24:38,535 --> 00:24:40,736
I'm sorry, okay? I'm so sorry.

425
00:24:40,787 --> 00:24:42,488
There has to be another way, Claire.

426
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,156
There has to be another way.

427
00:24:55,251 --> 00:24:57,920
What is that?

428
00:24:57,971 --> 00:25:00,222
That's how they're gonna do it.

429
00:25:02,759 --> 00:25:05,978
That's how they're gonna kill Minx.

430
00:25:15,327 --> 00:25:16,695
We have to do whatever it takes.

431
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:17,741
We have to save her.

432
00:25:17,793 --> 00:25:20,177
What happens if the president says no?

433
00:25:20,212 --> 00:25:21,345
That's not an option.

434
00:25:21,347 --> 00:25:24,782
- This isn't on you, Claire.
- Isn't it?

435
00:25:25,424 --> 00:25:26,890
You did what you had to do,

436
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,775
just like I did.

437
00:25:28,826 --> 00:25:29,910
What are you talking about?

438
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:35,632
I just talked to a reporter,
gave him the whole story.

439
00:25:35,726 --> 00:25:37,276
Sean, why would you do that?

440
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,028
Because this exposes everything.

441
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,030
They'll be forced to let our kids go.

442
00:25:41,064 --> 00:25:44,233
That's the only way we get Henry back home.

443
00:25:44,235 --> 00:25:46,368
I have to go.

444
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,837
I'll call you as soon as I can.

445
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:50,556
I just got off with the press secretary.

446
00:25:50,607 --> 00:25:52,875
Now it's their move.

447
00:25:52,909 --> 00:25:54,376
My contact at the White House,

448
00:25:54,411 --> 00:25:55,461
she's not making any promises,

449
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,712
but she's trying to get us a meeting.

450
00:25:56,714 --> 00:25:58,380
Okay. Let's go.

451
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:05,688
Mr. President, I'm sorry
for the interruption.

452
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:07,523
Excuse me, gentlemen.

453
00:26:11,461 --> 00:26:14,980
Uh... We got a call from
the Baltimore Observer.

454
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,299
They, uh...

455
00:26:17,334 --> 00:26:18,500
They know about Drill.

456
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,836
How long do we have?

457
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,321
Well, they say about two hours,

458
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,373
but I'm confident I can get
them to hold the story...

459
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:25,474
That won't be necessary.

460
00:26:25,508 --> 00:26:27,076
Excuse me?

461
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,278
It'll all be over in about two hours.

462
00:26:29,312 --> 00:26:32,181
I want to go live before the story breaks.

463
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,617
Sir, I have to advise against...

464
00:26:35,652 --> 00:26:38,871
Do you understand the kind of
panic that this could cause?

465
00:26:38,905 --> 00:26:41,039
No more than if the leader of this nation

466
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:44,476
is caught lying to the
very people who elected him.

467
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:47,996
No more hiding. No more secrets.

468
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:49,748
This is what must be done.

469
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:53,302
Yes, sir.

470
00:26:53,304 --> 00:26:57,289
Oh, and, Alan, one more thing.

471
00:26:57,323 --> 00:26:59,508
Get those children home.

472
00:26:59,542 --> 00:27:01,109
I want my daughter back.

473
00:27:01,144 --> 00:27:03,478
Yes, sir.

474
00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:09,968
Where are they taking us?

475
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,920
How should I know?

476
00:28:02,238 --> 00:28:04,906
In a few minutes, we're gonna
go live to the White House,

477
00:28:04,908 --> 00:28:06,174
where President Winters has called

478
00:28:06,208 --> 00:28:08,543
a last-minute press conference.

479
00:28:13,816 --> 00:28:15,083
Please. We don't have much time.

480
00:28:15,117 --> 00:28:16,284
- Okay, I just... I need...
- Wes, I'm...

481
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:17,836
- I need five minutes with him.
- Wes, I'm trying,

482
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,287
- but now this press conference has come up.
- look, you just...

483
00:28:19,338 --> 00:28:20,538
you just tell him that... that
there's an alternative, okay?

484
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:21,556
We don't have to pull
the trigger right now.

485
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,557
He'll know what I'm talking about.

486
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,192
- Okay. I'm trying.
- Please.

487
00:28:24,226 --> 00:28:25,410
You don't understand how important this is.
We don't have time.

488
00:28:25,444 --> 00:28:28,496
- Okay.
- Please.

489
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:38,790
I can't tell you what a relief that is.

490
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:40,625
I'll be right there. Thank you.

491
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:43,778
They're letting the kids out.

492
00:28:43,812 --> 00:28:46,281
So it worked.
Looks like Oberon came through.

493
00:28:46,315 --> 00:28:48,149
What's Oberon?

494
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,418
Secret service code name for the president.

495
00:28:50,452 --> 00:28:51,953
Each family member of the family has one.

496
00:28:51,987 --> 00:28:53,388
They all start with the same letter...

497
00:28:53,422 --> 00:28:57,191
first lady, she's Olympia.

498
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:00,528
And what about the daughter?

499
00:29:00,546 --> 00:29:02,747
Uh, don't know that one
off the top of my head.

500
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:03,798
Sean.

501
00:29:03,832 --> 00:29:06,217
Orion.

502
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,271
Sean, I can't... I can't talk right now.

503
00:29:10,273 --> 00:29:12,073
Claire, it's Cassandra. She's Drill.

504
00:29:12,107 --> 00:29:14,575
What?

505
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:17,044
Orion... it's Cassandra's
secret service code name.

506
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,796
What?

507
00:29:18,847 --> 00:29:21,265
You were right.

508
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,050
It isn't Minx.

509
00:29:23,101 --> 00:29:25,720
Copy that. Olympia and Orion on the move.

510
00:29:43,121 --> 00:29:45,226
He's in the White House.

511
00:29:48,029 --> 00:29:48,995
Drill framed Minx.

512
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:50,463
So Cassandra burned herself.

513
00:29:50,498 --> 00:29:52,048
- Henry?! She must have.
- Minx?

514
00:29:52,099 --> 00:29:53,266
With the evacuation of the children,

515
00:29:53,301 --> 00:29:54,618
there was so much chaos that we...

516
00:29:54,652 --> 00:29:56,119
we weren't looking at her.
We were looking at Minx.

517
00:29:58,873 --> 00:30:01,992
What about Silas? He said he saw Minx.

518
00:30:02,026 --> 00:30:04,611
He was telling the truth about
everything but who he saw.

519
00:30:04,613 --> 00:30:06,212
It was Cassandra who caught him.

520
00:30:06,214 --> 00:30:09,015
She's the one
who threatened to hurt his mom.

521
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,483
What about Maria's computer file?

522
00:30:10,485 --> 00:30:12,419
Cassandra knew that
we'd be able to retrieve it,

523
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:15,054
so she doctored Minx's file.

524
00:30:15,056 --> 00:30:17,157
Oh, Claire, I...

525
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:18,708
Go.

526
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:20,460
Stop them. I'll try
to get to the press room.

527
00:30:20,511 --> 00:30:21,428
Okay.

528
00:30:47,689 --> 00:30:49,856
Honey!

529
00:30:49,858 --> 00:30:50,957
Hey, buddy.

530
00:30:50,959 --> 00:30:53,142
Mommy, daddy, I'm here!

531
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:59,300
- Henry?
- Dad!

532
00:31:07,092 --> 00:31:08,606
Okay. Come here.

533
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:10,675
I'm sorry, Mr. Lawrence,

534
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:12,508
but Secretary Frommer is not available.

535
00:31:12,542 --> 00:31:14,310
Tell him it's not Minx. It's Cassandra.

536
00:31:14,312 --> 00:31:15,661
I can leave word that it's urgent.

537
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,796
Damn it!

538
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:22,068
Twinkle, twinkle, little star...

539
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:29,275
How I wonder what you are.

540
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:38,017
Up above the world so high...

541
00:31:38,068 --> 00:31:43,556
Like a diamond in the sky.

542
00:31:47,661 --> 00:31:50,546
When the blazing sun is gone...

543
00:31:50,548 --> 00:31:55,117
When he nothing shines upon...

544
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,990
Then you show your little light.

545
00:32:01,324 --> 00:32:03,208
Twinkle, twinkle...

546
00:32:05,896 --> 00:32:06,812
All the night.

547
00:32:07,864 --> 00:32:09,281
You look nervous.

548
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:13,936
Well, I suppose I am a little.

549
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,989
Do you remember what you
always tell me when I'm scared?

550
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,591
"Be brave."

551
00:32:19,626 --> 00:32:23,195
All right, well, I will, uh...
I will try to keep that in mind.

552
00:32:23,246 --> 00:32:25,664
Wait, w-what are you...
what are you saying?

553
00:32:25,699 --> 00:32:26,849
The president, he's the target?

554
00:32:26,883 --> 00:32:28,217
But it doesn't make any sense.

555
00:32:28,268 --> 00:32:29,902
If Drill wanted to kill the president,

556
00:32:29,936 --> 00:32:32,104
he could've possessed
Cassandra a long time ago.

557
00:32:32,155 --> 00:32:33,589
Why wait this long?

558
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:39,695
Press conference.

559
00:32:39,746 --> 00:32:41,580
He's not after the president.

560
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:42,998
What do you mean?

561
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,266
The broadcast.

562
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:47,569
Jessup, it's a live feed.

563
00:33:01,384 --> 00:33:03,151
I'm Special Agent Claire Bennigan.

564
00:33:03,186 --> 00:33:07,205
Please, I need you to listen to me.

565
00:33:07,256 --> 00:33:09,975
The press conference...
You have to stop it.

566
00:33:12,245 --> 00:33:13,996
I'm gonna have to ask you to step back.

567
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,932
You don't understand.
This is how he's gonna do it.

568
00:33:21,571 --> 00:33:24,072
My fellow Americans...

569
00:33:24,107 --> 00:33:28,710
To friends watching around the world...

570
00:33:28,744 --> 00:33:32,230
Be brave.

571
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:37,519
That's what my daughter said
to me before I walked in here.

572
00:33:37,553 --> 00:33:40,989
Such simple words from a child,

573
00:33:41,023 --> 00:33:43,925
but not always easy to do.

574
00:33:45,462 --> 00:33:50,749
Then the traveler in the dark...

575
00:33:50,783 --> 00:33:54,936
Thanks you for your tiny spark...

576
00:33:57,106 --> 00:33:59,541
Mr. Secretary.

577
00:33:59,575 --> 00:34:04,713
I'm sorry, sir. It's... I can't.

578
00:34:04,715 --> 00:34:06,481
Walk me through each step
of the launch sequence.

579
00:34:08,451 --> 00:34:10,652
I'll push the button.

580
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,328
Be brave.

581
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:21,896
We all do.

582
00:34:21,898 --> 00:34:24,566
'Cause what I am about to tell you

583
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,917
- may be hard to accept.
- Halt!

584
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:27,969
Halt! Don't move!

585
00:34:28,003 --> 00:34:29,521
Stop! Look out!

586
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,290
We're on him!

587
00:34:39,896 --> 00:34:41,864
For the last few weeks,

588
00:34:41,898 --> 00:34:45,601
our country, our world,

589
00:34:45,635 --> 00:34:47,887
has been battling a secret war

590
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:52,875
provoked by a silent and deadly enemy,

591
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:56,879
an enemy unlike any which
we've fought before...

592
00:34:56,913 --> 00:35:01,033
an enemy not from our world.

593
00:35:03,287 --> 00:35:09,108
This being did not come to
our world in peace.

594
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:11,744
But before we succumb to panic,

595
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:16,832
I am here to tell you that this war is over

596
00:35:16,883 --> 00:35:18,534
and we have won.

597
00:35:21,488 --> 00:35:26,642
The alien threat has
been captured, contained.

598
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:30,079
By the time that we are done here,

599
00:35:30,113 --> 00:35:31,547
it will have been destroyed.

600
00:35:31,581 --> 00:35:35,050
Sequence initiated.

601
00:35:35,052 --> 00:35:38,520
Weapon will fire in 60 seconds.

602
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:49,698
What's the matter, sweetheart?

603
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:53,635
Weapon will fire in 50 seconds.

604
00:35:53,637 --> 00:35:56,805
I'm ready to see my mommy now.

605
00:36:02,345 --> 00:36:05,697
Weapon will fire in 30 seconds.

606
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,500
Sir!

607
00:36:08,534 --> 00:36:10,519
Sir, it's not Minx! She's not Drill!
What is he doing in here?

608
00:36:10,553 --> 00:36:12,237
Please open the door, sir!

609
00:36:12,322 --> 00:36:16,541
No. No. No. She's gonna do it.

610
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:18,894
Wes, you do not want to be here.

611
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:21,530
It's cassandra!
It's the president's daughter!

612
00:36:21,564 --> 00:36:22,998
Sir! Weapon will fire in 15 seconds.

613
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:25,500
She's gonna send the signal.

614
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:56,865
10...

615
00:36:56,899 --> 00:36:58,416
- 9...
- Mr. Secretary.

616
00:36:58,451 --> 00:36:59,533
8...7...

617
00:36:59,558 --> 00:37:00,885
There's been an incident at the White House.

618
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,637
- 6...
- Yeah?

619
00:37:02,672 --> 00:37:04,940
- 5...4...
- Oh, my God.

620
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:07,308
- Stop the countdown.
- ...3...2...

621
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:08,827
Sequence aborted.

622
00:37:15,217 --> 00:37:16,734
Cassandra?

623
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:29,597
Is that Drill?

624
00:37:29,632 --> 00:37:32,033
Yeah. It is.

625
00:37:32,035 --> 00:37:34,202
Did he send the signal?

626
00:37:34,204 --> 00:37:35,870
I think so.

627
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:39,140
What does this mean?

628
00:37:39,191 --> 00:37:42,110
It means we're in trouble.

629
00:37:53,722 --> 00:37:55,673
My angel.

630
00:37:58,594 --> 00:38:01,529
What happened?

631
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:21,115
Don't worry, Claire.
I'm not going anywhere.

632
00:38:23,235 --> 00:38:25,486
No, daddy.

633
00:38:25,521 --> 00:38:26,521
It's okay.

634
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:27,822
- Get me out!
- It's okay.

635
00:38:27,856 --> 00:38:29,357
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

636
00:38:29,408 --> 00:38:30,942
Get me out! Okay.

637
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:32,493
It's all right.

638
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:34,462
It's all right.

639
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:36,180
Okay.

640
00:38:36,214 --> 00:38:37,765
It's okay.

641
00:38:38,801 --> 00:38:39,850
Come here.

642
00:38:39,902 --> 00:38:41,519
Here we go. All right, okay.

643
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:45,439
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

644
00:38:45,441 --> 00:38:48,209
All right. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.

645
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,795
You're safe now.

646
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:54,382
I knew you'd come for me, daddy.

647
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:55,883
Okay.

648
00:38:55,885 --> 00:38:57,818
All right. All right.

649
00:38:57,853 --> 00:38:59,687
It's okay. It's okay.

650
00:39:27,148 --> 00:39:29,817
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
How I wonder what you are.

651
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:30,818
Minx?

652
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:35,406
I was just saying the poem you taught me.

653
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,958
Oh. What?

654
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:41,161
Did you have another bad dream?

655
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,830
I'm okay. I'm not scared.

656
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,466
Oh. Well, I'm very proud of you.

657
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,802
But just so you know,
if you ever are scared,

658
00:39:48,837 --> 00:39:54,174
if you ever need me,
I promise I'll always be here.

659
00:39:54,176 --> 00:39:55,592
I know, daddy.

660
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:00,180
There.
