1
00:00:00,174 --> 00:00:02,228
Previously on The Strain...

2
00:00:02,258 --> 00:00:04,179
I found a way to kill these things. 
It's a bio-weapon.

3
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:06,999
It's crude, it needs to
be refined, but it works.

4
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:09,378
- Goodweather.
- He's here for me, not for you.

5
00:00:09,408 --> 00:00:11,486
No! Wait!

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,303
Who put this up?

7
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:18,358
That's your friend from
the convenience store?

8
00:00:18,388 --> 00:00:20,521
We were more than just friends.

9
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,472
- Men or women?
- I specialize

10
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:24,802
in passionate, destructive relationships.

11
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,478
The best kind.

12
00:00:27,564 --> 00:00:30,398
This airport's in a restricted
area. There's a quarantine.

13
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:33,992
I sensed him when he was injured.

14
00:00:34,022 --> 00:00:37,155
I will stop him, but for my own reasons...

15
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,991
which you well know.

16
00:00:40,076 --> 00:00:42,443
I need to know who got
close enough to hurt him.

17
00:00:42,529 --> 00:00:46,114
And I need human hunters.
That is, if you have any left.

18
00:00:51,169 --> 00:00:54,173
They called him the Barbarian Gladiator.

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,508
A warrior like none other.

20
00:00:56,594 --> 00:00:59,545
Unmatched in speed,

21
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,096
strength and savagery.

22
00:01:06,309 --> 00:01:08,687
He defeated every challenger...

23
00:01:08,773 --> 00:01:12,524
man and beast.

24
00:01:13,329 --> 00:01:25,237
None lasted more than a few minutes.
Most, not more than a few seconds.

25
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:28,917
Please.

26
00:02:28,952 --> 00:02:33,171
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

27
00:02:33,257 --> 00:02:36,508
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

28
00:02:36,593 --> 00:02:41,346
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

29
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:44,966
It's not I who wants this outcome.

30
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,053
Your own kind demands it.

31
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:12,928
A senator

32
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:16,498
with more than a passing
familiarity with the dark arts

33
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,734
sponsored the Barbarian Gladiator.

34
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:36,796
They call you the Night Demon of Sicily.

35
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:39,968
It took an entire army
detachment to capture you

36
00:03:39,998 --> 00:03:42,255
at the cost of 20 soldiers.

37
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:45,994
They wanted me so badly;
I decided to see what for.

38
00:03:46,029 --> 00:03:49,865
You were to be crucified.
The games saved you.

39
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:52,796
The greed of the Patrician
class and the savage impulse

40
00:03:52,826 --> 00:03:55,353
of the masses saved me.

41
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,774
You care not for food or drink.

42
00:03:59,603 --> 00:04:01,910
You care only for the juice of one animal.

43
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:05,001
The human animal.

44
00:04:08,964 --> 00:04:12,387
You bleed white, yet you
tolerate exposure to the sun.

45
00:04:13,574 --> 00:04:15,290
You are the half-breed,

46
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:19,888
birthed of human flesh and demon blood,

47
00:04:20,287 --> 00:04:23,937
possessed of a God-like
strength and agility.

48
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:26,101
Why do you not escape?

49
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,970
I am a student of human
instinct and behavior.

50
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,408
I find I learn best as their instrument.

51
00:04:38,296 --> 00:04:41,633
If you want to learn
about man's true nature,

52
00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:44,169
I can offer you a complete education...

53
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:50,492
on the field of battle.

_

56
00:05:23,594 --> 00:05:24,961
Hey.

57
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,591
You watching me dream?

58
00:05:30,251 --> 00:05:33,636
I was just waiting for you to wake up.

59
00:05:41,201 --> 00:05:43,655
I'm sorry I wasn't there last night.

60
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:48,922
Just... still working through some things.

61
00:05:54,542 --> 00:05:56,909
Poor Fitzwilliam.

62
00:05:57,755 --> 00:06:00,279
Yeah, that's too bad.

63
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:06,085
He could've been helpful to us, you know?

64
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:09,477
I don't want to get dressed.

65
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,282
I don't want you to get dressed either.

66
00:06:14,464 --> 00:06:17,463
- That's not what I meant.
- Are you sure?

67
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:21,731
I have been wearing the
same three outfits for days.

68
00:06:22,392 --> 00:06:24,270
Maybe I should go and
get the rest of my things.

69
00:06:24,532 --> 00:06:26,305
You should!

70
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:29,392
Just clear all your stuff out

71
00:06:30,403 --> 00:06:32,478
and move them in here.

72
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:36,065
Moving my things in.

73
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:39,041
And that's not a commitment or anything.

74
00:06:39,071 --> 00:06:41,145
Of course not.

75
00:06:50,585 --> 00:06:54,676
_

76
00:07:10,154 --> 00:07:11,734
What about the furniture?

77
00:07:12,552 --> 00:07:13,741
Is it yours?

78
00:07:13,771 --> 00:07:17,018
Most of it's Nikki's. Paid
for by her generous mother.

79
00:07:19,193 --> 00:07:23,251
- Is that the wrong key?
- No, it's dead bolted

80
00:07:23,281 --> 00:07:25,899
- from the inside.
- Step back.

81
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:42,882
I don't smell vamp shit.

82
00:07:42,967 --> 00:07:46,619
Vamps don't lock doors. Squatters.

83
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:50,686
Show yourself!

84
00:07:54,888 --> 00:07:56,362
Hey.

85
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:06,857
Nikki!

86
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:10,308
Oh, my God!

87
00:08:10,393 --> 00:08:12,030
Oh, my God!

88
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,982
- You're alive.
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

89
00:08:16,012 --> 00:08:19,803
Are you OK? Are you OK?

90
00:08:20,764 --> 00:08:24,537
_

91
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:35,939
Everything all right, Mr. Palmer?

92
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:39,604
I'm sorry, I was just thinking.

93
00:08:39,673 --> 00:08:43,397
Looks like an absolutely gorgeous day.

94
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:46,595
Maybe I'll take a ride later.

95
00:08:46,865 --> 00:08:48,992
Perhaps you'd like to accompany me?

96
00:08:49,022 --> 00:08:51,283
That sounds wonderful.

97
00:08:52,542 --> 00:08:55,254
Mr. Palmer, excuse me. I
have an update on Goodweather.

98
00:08:55,803 --> 00:08:58,156
Coco, could I trouble you

99
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:01,159
for a cup of that wonderful
herbal tea you recommended?

100
00:09:01,228 --> 00:09:04,382
Certainly, Mr. Palmer.

101
00:09:09,204 --> 00:09:11,620
Sorry, sir. You said you
wanted to be updated right away.

102
00:09:11,705 --> 00:09:14,406
- Yes, yes. What happened?
- Leavitt's dead.

103
00:09:14,475 --> 00:09:16,408
Goodweather shot him and got away somehow.

104
00:09:16,477 --> 00:09:19,177
- Has Leavitt's body been found?
- No, we took care of that.

105
00:09:20,028 --> 00:09:22,398
- And Goodweather's bio-weapon? 
- In friendly hands.

106
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:24,850
- It's contained.
- For now. He certainly could

107
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:27,263
reformulate it.

108
00:09:28,355 --> 00:09:30,439
How soon until he's taken care of?

109
00:09:30,524 --> 00:09:32,591
That's the thing, sir.
We've lost his trail.

110
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:34,559
We don't know where he is.

111
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,737
- Everything OK?
- Couldn't be better.

112
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:10,989
- Do you have chilled bourbon?
- Well, I've got bourbon

113
00:11:11,075 --> 00:11:13,208
and I've got ice.

114
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,044
Bourbon straight. Double, please.

115
00:11:30,677 --> 00:11:33,938
You know, some people like to sip...

116
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,473
and enjoy.

117
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:42,070
Maybe next time.

118
00:11:42,156 --> 00:11:46,108
After the convenience store, I
came back here looking for you.

119
00:11:46,193 --> 00:11:48,777
I didn't come back, not right away.

120
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:50,932
I was scared out of my mind.

121
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:54,353
Those creepers at the gas station,
they gave up on me pretty quickly.

122
00:11:54,383 --> 00:11:56,570
That's 'cause they weren't there for you.

123
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,673
- They were there for the old man.
- So, you stayed with them?

124
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:02,474
- Those strangers from the store?
- Yeah, well, I didn't have

125
00:12:02,543 --> 00:12:05,053
a choice at first. And then...

126
00:12:07,013 --> 00:12:09,370
Yeah, I stayed with them.

127
00:12:10,395 --> 00:12:12,884
She joined the fight.

128
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,861
She's a hell of a fighter
too. How 'bout you, Nikki?

129
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:17,970
Where you been all this time?

130
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,992
You been hiding out in
that closet, or what?

131
00:12:22,022 --> 00:12:24,785
I, uh, strained my ankle,

132
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:27,232
falling, running from those things.

133
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:29,901
I thought it was a fracture.
I tried to go to the ER, but

134
00:12:29,987 --> 00:12:33,670
I got so scared. I've been holed
up in here every night since.

135
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:38,827
I'm so glad you're alive.

136
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,967
Well, it's, uh, it's great.

137
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:47,534
It's really, really heartwarming.

138
00:12:47,564 --> 00:12:49,630
It really, it really is.

139
00:12:50,275 --> 00:12:51,754
- But...
- Yeah.

140
00:12:51,784 --> 00:12:54,316
Setrakian... He's waiting for us, right?

141
00:12:54,346 --> 00:12:55,836
Yeah.

142
00:12:55,866 --> 00:12:58,110
You said you wanted to come
back here to get your clothes...

143
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,617
Why don't we both get our things.

144
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,875
It's so much safer there.

145
00:13:15,013 --> 00:13:16,680
We have company.

146
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:19,259
- You're from the convenience store.
- It's me.

147
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:22,030
This is Nikki, my roommate.
This is Nora. She's a doctor.

148
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,028
She has a bad ankle.

149
00:13:23,058 --> 00:13:25,237
She hurt herself running away.

150
00:13:26,731 --> 00:13:29,489
- Tell me where it hurts.
- I've been waiting for you

151
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,636
- all morning. We need to go.
- Just give me one second.

152
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:34,582
Hey, Dutch.

153
00:13:34,668 --> 00:13:38,136
- Can I have a moment, please?
- How about later, yeah?

154
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,746
How 'bout now?

155
00:13:52,321 --> 00:13:54,218
So?

156
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:56,831
So?

157
00:13:57,256 --> 00:13:59,236
Aren't you going to ask her?

158
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:01,292
About the money that
mysteriously disappeared from

159
00:14:01,322 --> 00:14:05,321
- your apartment? Your laptop?
- None of that's important now, is it?

160
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,332
She's terrified.

161
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:09,551
She's been through it.

162
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:10,862
Oh,

163
00:14:11,872 --> 00:14:16,463
is that why you seem,
uh, a little reluctant

164
00:14:16,493 --> 00:14:18,332
to tell her about us?

165
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:23,515
She is dealing with so much right now.

166
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,993
Just give her time. And me.

167
00:14:28,872 --> 00:14:30,556
Give you time?

168
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:37,053
What for?

169
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,654
I've got to get back to her.

170
00:14:40,684 --> 00:14:42,840
Dutch, Setrakian needs us.

171
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:45,225
He wants to go to that factory

172
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:47,928
that Fitzwilliam told us about, so...

173
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,030
I can't leave her here like this.

174
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:52,812
You understand that, right?

175
00:14:53,746 --> 00:14:56,498
Yeah. OK.

176
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,551
- You can handle this. 
- Mm-hmm.

177
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:02,671
- You go.
- I will.

178
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:11,012
Mr. Fet!

179
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:17,397
Coming!

180
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,336
_

181
00:15:22,366 --> 00:15:25,129
"She's dealing with so much right now."

182
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,861
Dealing with what? Leaving
her apartment closet?

183
00:15:27,891 --> 00:15:31,316
- What? A twisted ankle?
- Mr. Fet. Your romantic worries

184
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:34,773
have no relevance at
this moment. None at all.

185
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:36,859
You're right.

186
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:40,201
I have a very strong instinct about this.

187
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,270
Something very bad is happening here.

188
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,592
Well, let's have a closer look. After you.

189
00:16:08,388 --> 00:16:10,481
What's a school bus for blind kids

190
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:12,666
doing at a Stoneheart factory?

191
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:25,143
- I trust you've come prepared?
- I'm always prepared.

192
00:16:25,629 --> 00:16:27,126
Control, this is Security Officer...

193
00:16:41,197 --> 00:16:43,676
So, what about the big guy? The Russian.

194
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,806
- What about him?
- What's his deal?

195
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:50,954
He doesn't really have a deal.

196
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:52,914
That's kind of the nice thing about him.

197
00:16:52,944 --> 00:16:54,668
What you see is what you get.

198
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,836
So, what are the sleeping

199
00:16:56,866 --> 00:16:58,396
arrangements here? Where's your, um...

200
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:06,099
Alright!

201
00:17:10,004 --> 00:17:12,221
Dr. Goodweather, I presume.

202
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:15,457
How did it go in DC?

203
00:17:15,487 --> 00:17:17,694
Total success by the looks of it.

204
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:20,891
Do I know you? Because I feel like I do.

205
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:25,162
Hey, yeah, we all met that fateful
night at the convenience store?

206
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:29,081
The track star! That's right! Welcome back.

207
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,367
Uh, where's Fet?

208
00:17:31,403 --> 00:17:33,798
Out, with Setrakian.

209
00:17:33,828 --> 00:17:37,713
- Is Zack in?
- Yeah, in his room.

210
00:17:37,748 --> 00:17:40,254
Alright, OK. Why don't you just sit down

211
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:41,454
before you fall down? Come on.

212
00:17:41,484 --> 00:17:44,803
Sure, I should get some shut-eye.

213
00:17:45,352 --> 00:17:46,956
Nora's napping up there.

214
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:50,865
- She'll be glad to see you're home.
- Yeah, maybe I should lie down

215
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:53,329
in yours and Fet's room.

216
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:19,888
These critters.

217
00:18:20,462 --> 00:18:21,672
Dead.

218
00:18:24,175 --> 00:18:25,694
Necks snapped.

219
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:28,264
Culled from the herd.

220
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:32,401
What is this, like a mass grave?

221
00:18:33,127 --> 00:18:34,672
The opposite.

222
00:18:34,702 --> 00:18:36,398
A nursery.

223
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,544
Blind kids.

224
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:43,546
That just ain't right.

225
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:51,170
- Professor!
- I hear it.

226
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,040
- They're coordinated.
- The Master.

227
00:19:12,306 --> 00:19:14,510
Yeah.

228
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:18,381
I'm just gonna keep on
firing, hope I get lucky.

229
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:22,218
Just in case, I'm gonna
save the last two for us.

230
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:27,741
Now, come on, you little
monkeys! Come on! Bring it!

231
00:19:27,771 --> 00:19:29,680
Let's do this!

232
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:42,955
Mr. Fet.

233
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,074
What?

234
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,513
Hello, Professor.

235
00:21:07,189 --> 00:21:10,107
And to think I was looking
forward to a nice car ride.

236
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:12,826
Perspective, Coco. Difficult to maintain

237
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:15,195
but critical for success.

238
00:21:15,281 --> 00:21:17,447
I've never been this high
above the city before.

239
00:21:25,257 --> 00:21:27,758
I'm sorry, I have to ask:

240
00:21:28,674 --> 00:21:30,444
earlier today your head
of security mentioned

241
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:33,002
- a Dr. Goodweather?
- The disgraced

242
00:21:33,032 --> 00:21:35,999
CDC epidemiologist? Yes.

243
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:39,119
Apparently, he found his
way down to Washington DC

244
00:21:39,205 --> 00:21:42,706
and murdered three people,
including his former boss,

245
00:21:43,241 --> 00:21:45,542
Dr. Everett Barnes.

246
00:21:46,128 --> 00:21:49,262
Everett was a dear friend of mine.

247
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:51,954
Joshua was just breaking the news to me.

248
00:21:51,984 --> 00:21:54,184
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
- It's tragic.

249
00:21:54,568 --> 00:21:57,654
As terrible as this plague
has been for New York City,

250
00:21:57,689 --> 00:22:00,379
there is something to
be said for regeneration.

251
00:22:00,409 --> 00:22:03,210
Yellowstone National Park, for example.

252
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:05,913
Much of it burned in a massive wildfire.

253
00:22:05,998 --> 00:22:10,000
Ten years later, the landscape
was completely renewed.

254
00:22:10,344 --> 00:22:14,838
And while no one would ever wish
for a catastrophe such as this,

255
00:22:15,697 --> 00:22:19,259
complacency is the enemy of empires.

256
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:21,345
Just ask the Romans.

257
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:38,013
The Ancients gave me your name,

258
00:22:38,464 --> 00:22:40,964
Professor Setrakian.

259
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:43,267
I followed you here.

260
00:22:43,335 --> 00:22:45,936
But... who are you?

261
00:22:46,005 --> 00:22:48,605
My name is Quinlan.

262
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:50,941
And you and I have something
very much in common.

263
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,744
- What's that?
- We are both

264
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,746
hunting the Master.

265
00:22:56,582 --> 00:22:59,299
You know the Ancients?

266
00:22:59,748 --> 00:23:01,852
Hold on. What are the Ancients?

267
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:04,388
What the hell is this guy?

268
00:23:04,473 --> 00:23:07,090
If you discharge that
weapon in my direction,

269
00:23:07,972 --> 00:23:11,778
I shall come over there
and tear you in half.

270
00:23:14,282 --> 00:23:17,022
I see you've been hunting
the Master for some time.

271
00:23:17,052 --> 00:23:20,086
Most of my life. You?

272
00:23:22,274 --> 00:23:24,372
All of mine.

273
00:23:25,717 --> 00:23:27,574
_

274
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:40,457
You from this place?

275
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:44,127
Sire. This home is abandoned.

276
00:23:44,213 --> 00:23:47,714
The entire village... forsaken.

277
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:51,251
Accursed. First, it was the children.

278
00:23:51,336 --> 00:23:55,160
Drawn from their beds, taken
in sleep. The next night,

279
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:57,557
they returned to spread
the sleeping sickness

280
00:23:57,643 --> 00:24:00,978
to their kin. Soon after, the
healthy fled for their lives.

281
00:24:01,457 --> 00:24:03,981
The ghosts still come down after nightfall.

282
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:06,400
The giant in the castle.

283
00:24:07,384 --> 00:24:08,402
Is he still here?

284
00:24:08,487 --> 00:24:11,788
- You know this tale, sire?
- This tale is what brought me

285
00:24:11,874 --> 00:24:15,492
to this place. But now
I fear I am too late.

286
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:13,633
So it is "Sardu" now?

287
00:25:16,672 --> 00:25:18,810
Your new host body no longer requires

288
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,545
this fine cane.

289
00:25:29,265 --> 00:25:31,351
You knew I would hear of the strange tale

290
00:25:31,436 --> 00:25:33,887
of the possessed giant and come for you.

291
00:25:33,956 --> 00:25:36,523
I suppose that's why you left these here.

292
00:25:37,237 --> 00:25:38,558
To taunt me.

293
00:25:42,564 --> 00:25:45,532
But your vigilance belies a deeper concern.

294
00:25:49,744 --> 00:25:50,704
Your fear.

295
00:25:55,715 --> 00:25:57,978
You know this cane.

296
00:25:58,746 --> 00:26:01,130
The Sardu legend.

297
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:05,456
That cane is proof that it is not a legend.

298
00:26:05,486 --> 00:26:09,989
There are no myths, Professor.

299
00:26:10,041 --> 00:26:11,381
Only exaggerations.

300
00:26:11,411 --> 00:26:15,044
Or hidden truths, such as the Ancients.

301
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:16,408
What did they tell you?

302
00:26:16,438 --> 00:26:18,862
They told me about a mortal

303
00:26:18,892 --> 00:26:24,503
who'd succeeded in hunting
down and wounding the Master.

304
00:26:24,555 --> 00:26:26,679
The Dark Lord has taken on various forms

305
00:26:26,709 --> 00:26:30,042
over the centuries, but always by choice.

306
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:32,812
No one has ever forced him to transform.

307
00:26:34,249 --> 00:26:36,349
Until now.

308
00:26:36,418 --> 00:26:38,585
He has taken on a new form?

309
00:26:38,654 --> 00:26:41,960
And yet your first victory is
a minor one compared to this.

310
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,957
What's that?

311
00:26:44,927 --> 00:26:47,727
You have led me to his nesting place.

312
00:26:47,812 --> 00:26:49,779
His... his what?

313
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:52,899
Here?

314
00:26:54,386 --> 00:26:56,303
What the hell just happened?

315
00:26:56,388 --> 00:26:59,111
- He's here. In this building.
- I got that part.

316
00:26:59,141 --> 00:27:00,713
But what the hell was that?

317
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:04,130
We can't let the Master
escape. We must bring down

318
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,260
this structure on the Master.

319
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:08,013
Well, we can do that.

320
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,858
It'll be pretty messy, though

321
00:27:09,888 --> 00:27:12,152
And what about your new
friend, Mr. Myth, over there?

322
00:27:12,182 --> 00:27:14,287
Nothing matters more than destroying

323
00:27:14,356 --> 00:27:17,324
the Master! Go! Fast as you can!

324
00:27:17,984 --> 00:27:19,910
Stay close.

325
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:34,752
Why didn't you wake me?

326
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:37,771
My God!

327
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,774
What happened?

328
00:27:44,251 --> 00:27:46,379
Kelly got close, Eph.

329
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:49,015
Setrakian thinks the Master
has made her one of the more

330
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:52,219
- sentient strigoi.
- Jesus Christ.

331
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:54,888
I'm pretty sure Zack saw her.

332
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:57,891
You need to talk to him.

333
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,627
Maybe he didn't.

334
00:28:00,696 --> 00:28:02,468
Don't downplay this, Eph!

335
00:28:02,498 --> 00:28:05,899
They nearly got us. She's not gonna stop.

336
00:28:08,237 --> 00:28:10,971
I'm so sorry.

337
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,973
I should've been there for Zack.

338
00:28:13,042 --> 00:28:16,176
It just... It seemed so good.
Like it was all coming together.

339
00:28:20,249 --> 00:28:24,117
And then it was all taken away.

340
00:28:25,088 --> 00:28:27,054
It was Eldrich Palmer.

341
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,556
You're sure?

342
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:31,378
He had Rob murdered.

343
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:34,366
He's been five steps ahead
of us this entire time.

344
00:28:34,396 --> 00:28:36,313
From the plane right till now.

345
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,550
He hasn't beaten us.

346
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:43,453
We can grow more of the
bio-weapon ourselves.

347
00:28:44,464 --> 00:28:46,990
We'll take our time, make
it even more lethal...

348
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:51,462
I'm sorry; I'm all out
of optimism right now.

349
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:02,404
- Hey! Hey, what are you doing?
- You guys got

350
00:29:02,434 --> 00:29:04,729
- an emergency alarm here?
- Sure do.

351
00:29:04,759 --> 00:29:07,365
Better get someone to hit
it. Someone just called in

352
00:29:07,395 --> 00:29:09,625
- a bomb threat.
- Who?

353
00:29:09,655 --> 00:29:13,625
- Me!
- Hey! Hey!

354
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:17,483
We got a maniac with a bag of
dynamite. Evacuate! Evacuate!

355
00:29:17,513 --> 00:29:20,340
- Hurry! Let's go!
- Hurry!

356
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:37,807
What are you now?

357
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:51,738
I have been expecting you.

358
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:01,147
Welcome to the new world.

359
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,556
I see you had little time
to prepare your new vessel.

360
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:06,953
I chose this host for its loyalty.

361
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:09,723
Something you know nothing about.

362
00:30:09,792 --> 00:30:13,660
It lacks... intimidation.

363
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:19,323
You'd hoped to find me weakened and hurt.

364
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:23,570
- As ever, you are too late.
- What's this?

365
00:30:23,983 --> 00:30:26,223
Your new lapdog?

366
00:30:26,308 --> 00:30:28,391
I'm curious about something.

367
00:30:30,019 --> 00:30:31,978
Your power depends on darkness,

368
00:30:33,174 --> 00:30:36,016
invisibility, obscurity. Yet

369
00:30:36,424 --> 00:30:38,852
this siege

370
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:41,927
exposes you.

371
00:30:43,126 --> 00:30:44,691
Leaves you vulnerable.

372
00:30:48,086 --> 00:30:51,531
What is it you're after?

373
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,855
- You.
- Now it's a proper duel,

374
00:31:48,924 --> 00:31:51,725
complete with seconds.

375
00:31:51,793 --> 00:31:54,194
What a team you two make.

376
00:31:54,263 --> 00:31:57,964
United and crippled by lifelong hatred.

377
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:00,667
This human embarrassed you.

378
00:32:00,736 --> 00:32:03,002
Now I'm about to destroy you.

379
00:32:03,071 --> 00:32:05,722
On the contrary.

380
00:32:05,807 --> 00:32:08,358
I'll make you scream out in agony.

381
00:32:08,982 --> 00:32:11,027
As I did your mother.

382
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:20,370
No!

383
00:32:32,717 --> 00:32:36,018
I had him.

384
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:38,971
He was here.

385
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:47,069
You cost me a chance to
destroy him once and for all.

386
00:32:48,212 --> 00:32:50,366
Now he will shore up his defenses.

387
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:55,005
This is my fight. I will take it from here.

388
00:33:00,262 --> 00:33:02,195
Hey.

389
00:33:02,509 --> 00:33:05,014
You all right?

390
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,134
- Did we get him?
- They're gone.

391
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,470
Who, the Master or,
what, the other guy? Who?

392
00:33:12,941 --> 00:33:15,643
We gotta get outta here. C'mon.

393
00:33:17,071 --> 00:33:18,915
C'mon. Fast!

394
00:33:30,656 --> 00:33:31,812
Dad?

395
00:33:33,665 --> 00:33:35,409
Dad.

396
00:33:43,826 --> 00:33:45,226
So, what happened?

397
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:50,576
Things, uh, things didn't
go exactly as I had planned.

398
00:33:50,606 --> 00:33:53,617
But... why not?

399
00:33:53,685 --> 00:33:56,286
You said you had a solution.

400
00:33:56,506 --> 00:33:58,791
Well, sometimes a solution isn't enough.

401
00:33:58,821 --> 00:34:00,778
Sometimes you need to
knock down a lot of doors

402
00:34:00,827 --> 00:34:03,061
before you find the right way in.

403
00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:05,313
But, that's all over for now.

404
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:08,566
- I'm back for good.
- OK, good.

405
00:34:11,071 --> 00:34:13,038
Nora told me about last
night. That must have been

406
00:34:13,068 --> 00:34:17,308
- really scary.
- I think I saw Mom.

407
00:34:17,377 --> 00:34:20,278
- Was it Mom?
- I don't know. I wasn't there.

408
00:34:20,578 --> 00:34:23,147
Nora saw her.

409
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:25,917
- Tell him, Nora.
- I already did.

410
00:34:38,664 --> 00:34:42,433
Well, I do know that your
mother loved you very much.

411
00:34:42,501 --> 00:34:44,324
And sometimes, when people turn,

412
00:34:44,354 --> 00:34:49,139
that bonding instinct can
become a source of attraction.

413
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:51,865
Yeah, the "dear one"...

414
00:34:51,895 --> 00:34:54,512
Mr. Setrakian already told me about it.

415
00:34:54,581 --> 00:34:57,548
He did?

416
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,818
Well, I'm gonna keep you
safe. That's a promise.

417
00:35:02,983 --> 00:35:04,334
Hey Dad?

418
00:35:06,392 --> 00:35:08,459
Maybe you shouldn't promise.

419
00:35:08,528 --> 00:35:10,695
You know what happens
every time you promise.

420
00:35:10,988 --> 00:35:12,507
Cool.

421
00:35:12,537 --> 00:35:15,299
No promises.

422
00:35:15,368 --> 00:35:17,334
I promise not to promise.

423
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:23,797
I can't believe I'm actually
going to say this, but...

424
00:35:23,827 --> 00:35:26,460
you really should call your mother.

425
00:35:30,782 --> 00:35:32,327
These are up all over.

426
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:36,392
She's worried sick.

427
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:39,457
Have you been carrying this around?

428
00:35:43,223 --> 00:35:47,120
Hey. You're never going to
guess what we saw today...

429
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:50,440
Hi! We've been making
dinner for everyone. Um...

430
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:53,204
There was this guy, he was
leaving and loading up his car

431
00:35:53,290 --> 00:35:55,206
and he gave us some fresh tomatoes.

432
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,459
Yeah, that's great.

433
00:35:57,544 --> 00:35:59,919
- Hm.
- What happened?

434
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,546
What did you see?

435
00:36:01,955 --> 00:36:04,098
It can wait. People are hungry.

436
00:36:04,184 --> 00:36:08,801
Hey, Mr. Fet. How goes
the battle for New York?

437
00:36:09,229 --> 00:36:11,272
The prodigal son returns, huh?

438
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,424
So when do the, uh, fighter jets appear?

439
00:36:13,893 --> 00:36:16,093
You're still blowing up our fair city.

440
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:18,113
Yeah.

441
00:36:18,143 --> 00:36:20,565
I like to think I'm doing my share.

442
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,885
More than my share, actually.

443
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:26,343
We saved your boy last night.

444
00:36:26,373 --> 00:36:29,040
I guess it does take a
village to raise a kid...

445
00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:31,156
especially when his father ain't around.

446
00:36:31,186 --> 00:36:34,741
Hey, where the hell is this coming from?

447
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:37,771
Ah...

448
00:36:37,801 --> 00:36:41,119
I see a lot has changed since I left.

449
00:36:50,013 --> 00:36:51,818
Drink up, Doc.

450
00:36:51,848 --> 00:36:56,601
Everybody just make yourselves at home! Hm?

451
00:36:56,892 --> 00:37:01,074
Fet! Fet!

452
00:37:07,443 --> 00:37:10,893
- You happy now?
- I'm not the one he's running away from.

453
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:17,355
Ah! Reinforcements.

454
00:37:17,424 --> 00:37:20,225
Mm-hmm.

455
00:37:20,841 --> 00:37:23,494
Thank you. Cheers.

456
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:35,506
Today was amazing.

457
00:37:36,306 --> 00:37:38,277
It's rather nice to have a helicopter.

458
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,080
I'm learning so much from you.

459
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:46,055
- As am I from you.
- From me?

460
00:37:46,085 --> 00:37:47,946
Like what?

461
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:50,518
Well, as absurd as it may sound,

462
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:54,063
I had no idea how isolated I was.

463
00:37:54,093 --> 00:37:56,297
It's so reassuring to
have someone to talk to.

464
00:37:58,714 --> 00:38:01,298
I know you never married.

465
00:38:01,384 --> 00:38:04,802
No... long-term relationships?

466
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:08,338
No short-term relationships.

467
00:38:10,129 --> 00:38:11,714
A man of your success,

468
00:38:11,744 --> 00:38:14,234
- your power?
- Good health

469
00:38:14,264 --> 00:38:16,714
makes all the difference, my dear...

470
00:38:17,038 --> 00:38:18,883
even this late in life.

471
00:38:20,545 --> 00:38:22,937
It's not that late.

472
00:38:25,272 --> 00:38:26,874
Forgive me, I...

473
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:30,812
I'm not in the habit of opening up,

474
00:38:31,744 --> 00:38:33,898
even after two cocktails.

475
00:38:35,185 --> 00:38:36,692
Me neither.

476
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:43,825
How about a third?

477
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,744
It would put me right to sleep.

478
00:38:47,787 --> 00:38:49,719
So, where do you sleep?

479
00:38:49,936 --> 00:38:51,916
My bedroom is right above this room.

480
00:38:53,493 --> 00:38:55,311
Can I... Can I see?

481
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,860
This was more of

482
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:05,195
a hospital room than a proper bedroom

483
00:39:05,281 --> 00:39:07,197
for most of my adult life.

484
00:39:21,608 --> 00:39:22,985
Needs a woman's touch.

485
00:39:23,015 --> 00:39:26,717
Oh, my dear! You are simply exquisite.

486
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:31,294
But I'm certain I would only disappoint.

487
00:39:31,524 --> 00:39:34,391
Shut up. Just shut up,

488
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,549
Eldritch.

489
00:39:58,701 --> 00:40:01,152
His disappearance coincided

490
00:40:01,237 --> 00:40:04,002
with the fall of the Roman Empire.

491
00:40:05,956 --> 00:40:08,954
While his immediate fate was unknown,

492
00:40:08,984 --> 00:40:11,885
sightings persisted throughout Eurasia

493
00:40:11,915 --> 00:40:14,048
over centuries.

494
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:16,133
Yet to this day,

495
00:40:16,169 --> 00:40:19,337
no record exists to
explain where he came from

496
00:40:20,138 --> 00:40:22,273
nor how he was created.

497
00:40:23,102 --> 00:40:25,810
Perhaps a clue lies in the nickname

498
00:40:25,878 --> 00:40:28,262
given to him by his sponsor,

499
00:40:28,348 --> 00:40:31,182
Senator Sertorius:

500
00:40:31,936 --> 00:40:34,051
"The Born."

501
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:38,356
I don't understand.

502
00:40:40,266 --> 00:40:43,527
Is that a legend, or is it real?

503
00:40:45,232 --> 00:40:48,954
The answer to both questions is yes.

504
00:41:08,623 --> 00:41:11,155
- You OK, Doc?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

505
00:41:13,907 --> 00:41:16,193
Mm...

506
00:41:16,861 --> 00:41:19,096
Bartender made me promise I'd sip this,

507
00:41:19,165 --> 00:41:21,332
but, uh, booze is meant to make you

508
00:41:21,401 --> 00:41:23,668
feel good, not taste good.

509
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:27,455
DC was that bad, huh?

510
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:30,041
Worse.

511
00:41:31,928 --> 00:41:33,959
So...

512
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:38,015
Dutch's roommate Nikki, huh?

513
00:41:39,816 --> 00:41:41,484
Yeah.

514
00:41:41,553 --> 00:41:42,695
"I specialize

515
00:41:42,725 --> 00:41:47,720
in passionate, destructive relationships."

516
00:41:48,291 --> 00:41:51,053
I guess it was never meant to be.

517
00:41:54,131 --> 00:41:57,233
It's funny; you don't
strike me as a quitter.

518
00:41:57,302 --> 00:41:59,836
I think sometimes people
quit on you, you know?

519
00:42:03,374 --> 00:42:07,277
So Washington, DC didn't work out.

520
00:42:08,205 --> 00:42:11,781
What are you going to do now?

521
00:42:18,691 --> 00:42:21,307
I'm going to kill Eldritch Palmer.

522
00:42:21,337 --> 00:42:30,809
