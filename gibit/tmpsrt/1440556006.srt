1
00:00:00,019 --> 00:00:01,276
<i>Previously on Teen Wolf...</i>

2
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:02,717
Even if you don't trust me,

3
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:04,018
<i>I'm still going to be
looking out for you...</i>

4
00:00:04,052 --> 00:00:05,320
Scott. Promise me

5
00:00:05,354 --> 00:00:07,555
you'll do everything you can to save her.

6
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,657
I promise.

7
00:00:08,691 --> 00:00:09,523
They're here.

8
00:00:13,728 --> 00:00:15,929
She's getting worse. If she's a
real werewolf, we can save her.

9
00:00:15,963 --> 00:00:17,298
You gotta give her the bite.

10
00:00:17,332 --> 00:00:18,265
No.

11
00:00:19,921 --> 00:00:22,689
What do you mean, "No"?

12
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:24,324
Liam, look at her.

13
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:26,959
She's too weak. It will kill her.

14
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,694
We don't even know what
the mercury's doing to her.

15
00:00:28,729 --> 00:00:30,696
We don't even know if
it is actually mercury.

16
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:32,231
This can't be the only
way to save her life.

17
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:33,733
It saved mine.

18
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,635
You know, that was different.

19
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,369
You were hanging off a ledge.

20
00:00:37,403 --> 00:00:39,471
You promised.

21
00:00:39,506 --> 00:00:41,040
You said you'd do everything you could.

22
00:00:41,074 --> 00:00:43,341
Which is why I'm not going to do
something I think is going to kill her.

23
00:00:45,745 --> 00:00:46,978
There has to be...

24
00:00:50,282 --> 00:00:52,250
There has to...

25
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:53,952
Scott.

26
00:01:02,694 --> 00:01:04,227
There's another way to save her.

27
00:01:04,262 --> 00:01:06,463
Guys, I
don't know what the statistics are

28
00:01:06,497 --> 00:01:07,531
for surviving a werewolf bite,

29
00:01:07,565 --> 00:01:09,633
but she's definitely not surviving this.

30
00:01:09,668 --> 00:01:11,234
We need to do something.

31
00:01:24,414 --> 00:01:26,883
No.

32
00:02:42,988 --> 00:02:44,956
Unit 7, can you 10-9?
I didn't quite get that.

33
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,357
<i>10-4, Dispatch,</i>

34
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:48,760
<i>I'm southbound on Fryman
following suspicious individual</i>

35
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:50,361
<i>loping in the middle of the road.</i>

36
00:02:50,395 --> 00:02:51,562
7, clarify loping.

37
00:02:51,596 --> 00:02:53,064
<i>Uh... Running on all fours.</i>

38
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:54,966
<i>Suspect is possibly a large animal.</i>

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,333
<i>Unit 5 to Dispatch,</i>

40
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:57,834
<i>I'm turning the corner on Lincoln.</i>

41
00:02:57,869 --> 00:02:59,736
<i>Suspect no longer loping but running.</i>

42
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:01,238
10-4. Unit 5, clarify running.

43
00:03:01,272 --> 00:03:03,073
<i>Two legs. Moving fast.</i>

44
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:04,241
Copy, what's your speed?

45
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:05,275
<i>45 to 50.</i>

46
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:07,677
<i>Advise that suspect is
too large to be human.</i>

47
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:09,913
10-4, Unit 5, back off and maintain eyes.

48
00:03:09,947 --> 00:03:11,114
Dispatch to all units,

49
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,217
be on the lookout for
suspicious bipedal animal.

50
00:03:14,252 --> 00:03:16,118
<i>Unit 8 to Dispatch,
advise coming up on Taft,</i>

51
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:18,120
<i>animal is back on all fours and...</i>

52
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:19,255
<i>Holy...</i>

53
00:03:21,724 --> 00:03:24,160
Unit 8, it's Stilinski. Report.

54
00:03:24,194 --> 00:03:27,096
<i>10-4, Sheriff.
Suspect just leapt over my car.</i>

55
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,730
<i>Dispatch, I have
eyes on the suspect.</i>

56
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:30,299
<i>Corner of Union, heading north</i>

57
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:31,733
<i>towards Beacon Hills High School.</i>

58
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:33,301
<i>Confirm back on all fours.</i>

59
00:03:33,335 --> 00:03:35,170
Uh, 10-4, can you give its 20?

60
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:36,437
<i>In my rear view mirror.</i>

61
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:38,572
<i>Coming right toward
me. Advise suspect is...</i>

62
00:03:38,607 --> 00:03:39,440
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

63
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:40,875
Clark, back off...

64
00:03:45,347 --> 00:03:47,348
All available units
to Beacon Hills High School.

65
00:03:47,382 --> 00:03:48,616
Proceed with caution.

66
00:03:50,285 --> 00:03:51,384
Clark!

67
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:52,485
I'm here!

68
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:56,356
Sheriff, my car... It's wrecked.

69
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,325
I'm sorry, it's probably totaled.

70
00:03:58,359 --> 00:03:59,426
I ran half a mile to get here,

71
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,428
trying to follow the... The thing.

72
00:04:01,462 --> 00:04:03,496
Hey, hey, hey... Forget about the car.

73
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:04,531
Insurance will cover it.

74
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:06,032
Yeah, well...

75
00:04:06,066 --> 00:04:08,167
I wonder how much insurance the school has.

76
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:43,600
Success?

77
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:46,103
Imminent.

78
00:05:19,119 --> 00:05:24,281
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by</font> <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

79
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:26,708
Okay.

80
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:29,744
What's that?

81
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,445
It's called chelation therapy.

82
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:33,414
It removes heavy metals from the blood.

83
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:35,917
But, the problem is, is
that can injure the kidneys

84
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:37,785
and Hayden only has
one to begin with, so...

85
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:42,089
Hey, you're hurting her.

86
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:43,657
And you're hurting me.

87
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:50,196
- Sorry.
- Hey, guys...

88
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:52,799
Remember, we're here to save a life.

89
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,500
Not kill each other.

90
00:05:54,535 --> 00:05:56,202
It's the full moon.

91
00:05:56,237 --> 00:05:58,671
We can feel it even during the day.

92
00:05:58,705 --> 00:06:00,440
And it's a Supermoon.

93
00:06:00,474 --> 00:06:03,643
What is that supposed to make
you guys, like super strong?

94
00:06:03,677 --> 00:06:05,077
Super aggressive?

95
00:06:05,111 --> 00:06:06,178
Both.

96
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:46,649
You know we're going to need help with him.

97
00:06:48,786 --> 00:06:50,087
He'll be all right.

98
00:06:51,222 --> 00:06:52,990
He's 16 and in love.

99
00:06:54,292 --> 00:06:56,225
First love. You remember what that's like?

100
00:06:57,694 --> 00:06:59,728
Yeah, trust me, I remember.

101
00:06:59,762 --> 00:07:01,663
All those emotions
mixed with the Supermoon.

102
00:07:01,698 --> 00:07:02,764
Tonight isn't going to be good.

103
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:04,700
I know.

104
00:07:06,703 --> 00:07:07,803
We need help,

105
00:07:08,872 --> 00:07:11,540
and I don't mean restraints or chains.

106
00:07:11,574 --> 00:07:14,275
I mean Malia, Stiles, Lydia.

107
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,144
You need your pack, Scott.

108
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:19,280
I'm not so sure I have one anymore.

109
00:07:21,517 --> 00:07:22,717
Let me talk to them.

110
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:26,988
Let me see what I can do. Okay?

111
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,062
Theo.

112
00:07:36,597 --> 00:07:37,731
Thank you.

113
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:50,476
Go home, Lydia.

114
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,678
Stilinski isn't telling
anyone where he put the bodies,

115
00:07:52,712 --> 00:07:54,380
and I'm pretty sure I'm not psychic.

116
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:58,284
But you're drawn to death.

117
00:08:00,387 --> 00:08:01,820
Just like me.

118
00:08:04,157 --> 00:08:06,091
Does that make me a kind of Banshee?

119
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:09,827
You find bodies.

120
00:08:10,596 --> 00:08:12,097
I find Chimeras.

121
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:15,333
Dead Chimeras.

122
00:08:17,236 --> 00:08:19,204
So, we're both harbingers of death.

123
00:08:20,373 --> 00:08:22,639
I should probably add that to my resume.

124
00:08:22,674 --> 00:08:23,874
Hmm.

125
00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:27,844
It's on my college applications.

126
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:25,764
Can they fix it?

127
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:28,667
There's not enough duct tape
in the world to fix that thing.

128
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,138
Maybe you should try
something other than duct tape.

129
00:09:33,173 --> 00:09:35,274
It's got a bad alternator,

130
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,108
you know, needs all new belts,

131
00:09:37,142 --> 00:09:39,177
transmission's going...

132
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:41,579
The brake pads are
basically metal on metal.

133
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:46,317
How come you let it get so bad?

134
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:49,153
There's been a few distractions,
if you haven't noticed.

135
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,256
I notice.

136
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:54,091
More than you think I do.

137
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,261
Uh, I didn't mean it like that.

138
00:09:57,295 --> 00:09:58,695
Am I taking you home?

139
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,366
No. Sheriff station.

140
00:10:04,235 --> 00:10:05,769
I gotta talk to my dad.

141
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:08,705
Does it help knowing?

142
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,908
Knowing what you are?

143
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:13,609
It doesn't scare me as much.

144
00:10:14,978 --> 00:10:16,045
That I know.

145
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:19,448
Do I scare you?

146
00:10:20,017 --> 00:10:21,183
Once.

147
00:10:21,684 --> 00:10:22,618
Really?

148
00:10:29,191 --> 00:10:30,825
It was the night I found that werewolf,

149
00:10:30,859 --> 00:10:32,193
the one with the talons.

150
00:10:34,196 --> 00:10:36,197
I thought I was going to die that night.

151
00:10:36,598 --> 00:10:37,565
How come?

152
00:10:40,036 --> 00:10:41,469
Because I saw you.

153
00:10:42,871 --> 00:10:44,138
I saw the Banshee.

154
00:10:44,172 --> 00:10:46,640
But I guess it was just a
dream or a hallucination.

155
00:10:48,076 --> 00:10:49,243
What was I doing?

156
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:51,979
Trying to keep me alive.

157
00:10:52,013 --> 00:10:57,151
Well, sorry, but the Banshee was
mostly trying to stay out the rain.

158
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:02,088
That was the night of the storm, remember?

159
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,756
The Wild Hunt.

160
00:11:04,825 --> 00:11:06,259
The what?

161
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:08,227
Oh, it's something Kira was telling me.

162
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:11,331
A myth about thunderstorms...

163
00:11:11,365 --> 00:11:13,666
Ghost Riders in the sky and black dogs...

164
00:11:17,838 --> 00:11:19,471
What is it?

165
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:21,739
I need to check on something.

166
00:11:21,774 --> 00:11:23,675
I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere.

167
00:11:26,012 --> 00:11:27,212
You know what I mean.

168
00:11:30,383 --> 00:11:31,716
It's not working, is it?

169
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,286
She should be showing signs of improvement.

170
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:36,553
Hayden?

171
00:11:37,022 --> 00:11:38,122
Call Val...

172
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:41,692
My sister... Valerie.

173
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:43,361
She's a deputy.

174
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:44,528
I think I might know where she is.

175
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:45,929
Theo just texted me about the high school.

176
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:47,064
He said there's cops everywhere.

177
00:11:47,099 --> 00:11:47,798
Might be another Chimera.

178
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:49,967
Um, my sister...

179
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:52,702
I don't want to die without my sister.

180
00:11:53,204 --> 00:11:55,171
I'll get her.

181
00:11:55,206 --> 00:11:57,807
Uh, wait. What are you going to tell her?

182
00:11:57,841 --> 00:11:59,742
If I have to, I'll tell her everything.

183
00:12:04,248 --> 00:12:06,816
You want me to go in with you?

184
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,584
No, it's okay. It's probably
going to take a while.

185
00:12:17,727 --> 00:12:19,728
Are you going to tell him about Donovan?

186
00:12:23,833 --> 00:12:24,733
You knew?

187
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:26,567
I guessed.

188
00:12:27,903 --> 00:12:30,505
I saw the bite on your shoulder
while you were sleeping.

189
00:12:35,744 --> 00:12:37,412
It didn't matter to me.

190
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:41,849
That's why I never said anything.

191
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:46,353
It matters to me.

192
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,601
Sheriff left half an hour ago.

193
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:40,104
He said he was on his way back.

194
00:13:40,138 --> 00:13:42,439
Okay, thanks. I'll just wait in his office.

195
00:13:52,182 --> 00:13:53,682
"Woden's Hunt,

196
00:13:53,717 --> 00:13:56,852
"also known as the Wild Ride or Wild Hunt.

197

"The Hellhound."

205
00:14:30,718 --> 00:14:32,853
You know what's coming.

206
00:14:34,222 --> 00:14:35,789
Don't you?

207
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:37,924
Someone's going to die here.

208
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:38,859
You're right.

209
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:41,862
But I can't let you tell anyone.

210
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:43,463
Why?

211
00:14:44,365 --> 00:14:46,266
Because I want you, Lydia.

212
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,667
I want all of you.

213
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:49,202
What are you talking about?

214
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:51,404
Don't worry.

215
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:52,639
I'll give you some time to think about it.

216
00:15:40,185 --> 00:15:41,551
How did you do that?

217
00:15:49,027 --> 00:15:50,227
It's on her neck too.

218
00:15:51,396 --> 00:15:53,430
She's getting worse, isn't she?

219
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:55,699
Yeah. Which is why we're
taking her to the hospital.

220
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:57,133
How's that going to help?

221
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,802
We're in an animal clinic and I
need equipment designed for humans.

222
00:15:59,836 --> 00:16:01,570
I said that we're going to
take her to the hospital.

223
00:16:01,605 --> 00:16:03,039
I didn't say we're going
through the front door.

224
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:05,908
Hey, what's going on?

225
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:07,276
Somebody hit the fire alarm?

226
00:16:18,821 --> 00:16:19,821
Do you want to learn?

227
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:22,124
I can show you.

228
00:16:22,158 --> 00:16:23,691
You're showing me plenty right now.

229
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:27,329
I've got nothing to hide.

230
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:31,565
And I do?

231
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,434
Did you tell Scott you're
planning to kill your mother?

232
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,337
Don't worry, I'm not judging.

233
00:16:36,371 --> 00:16:38,339
I want to help you. Why?

234
00:16:39,007 --> 00:16:41,042
Because I know Scott won't.

235
00:16:41,076 --> 00:16:43,610
I'm trying to help all of you.

236
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:46,047
If Scott can't do it, then someone
else needs to take the lead.

237
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:47,781
You know they're moving
Hayden to the hospital, right?

238
00:16:48,815 --> 00:16:51,151
But Hayden's still a Chimera,

239
00:16:51,185 --> 00:16:52,352
and there's two more we haven't found yet,

240
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,187
and they're still dangerous.

241
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:57,190
They need help.

242
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:00,560
They need you.

243
00:17:29,321 --> 00:17:30,788
What the hell...

244
00:17:30,822 --> 00:17:32,557
Wait, wait, wait...
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

245
00:17:32,591 --> 00:17:34,058
Get back! Stay out of his way.

246
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:12,761
What's happening?

247
00:18:13,829 --> 00:18:15,463
I'm not sure.

248
00:18:15,498 --> 00:18:16,764
But it's definitely not good.

249
00:18:21,103 --> 00:18:22,203
My sister...

250
00:18:26,775 --> 00:18:30,044
Scott's out looking for her right now.

251
00:18:30,078 --> 00:18:32,779
He's going to bring her here
as soon as he can, all right?

252
00:18:44,592 --> 00:18:45,692
Hey, Lydia?

253
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:33,337
That's not possible.

254
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:35,038
You're right.

255
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,708
A werewolf shouldn't even be
able to touch mountain ash.

256
00:19:39,142 --> 00:19:40,310
You're a Chimera.

257
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:41,844
I'm the first Chimera.

258
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,947
It's the coyote part you don't notice.

259
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,518
It's why Malia trusted me first,

260
00:19:48,552 --> 00:19:51,187
even though she probably didn't know it.

261
00:19:51,222 --> 00:19:54,257
You found the perfect word though, Scott.

262
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:58,126
Because a Chimera isn't just
a monster with different parts.

263
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,295
It can also mean something
impossible to achieve.

264
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,963
An unrealizable dream.

265
00:20:03,065 --> 00:20:04,433
And they realized you?

266
00:20:04,467 --> 00:20:06,401
They came close with me.

267
00:20:06,436 --> 00:20:07,902
But we can't all be perfect.

268
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:10,805
We can't all be true Alphas.

269
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:19,880
Damn. I felt that.

270
00:20:22,817 --> 00:20:24,852
No calls, Scott.

271
00:20:24,886 --> 00:20:27,888
No Stiles, no Malia, no Lydia.

272
00:20:29,323 --> 00:20:32,359
You're just going to have to wait
here alone for what happens next.

273
00:20:32,393 --> 00:20:33,826
What do you mean?

274
00:20:35,329 --> 00:20:36,496
What's next?

275
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:38,498
The Supermoon.

276
00:20:48,843 --> 00:20:50,377
Over here, yeah.

277
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:52,179
Shouldn't we be talking
to one of the doctors?

278
00:20:52,214 --> 00:20:54,415
I've been wrestling with that for hours.

279
00:20:54,449 --> 00:20:55,583
Do we bring them in

280
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:58,451
and watch them treat
her as a normal patient,

281
00:20:58,485 --> 00:21:01,621
while we stand here knowing
that's not going to work?

282
00:21:01,655 --> 00:21:04,657
Or do we keep trying everything
medically possible to save her,

283
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:08,160
while her body does things that
shouldn't be medically possible?

284
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:10,330
Is she dying?

285
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:13,132
With the amount of mercury
in her body right now,

286
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,499
she shouldn't even be alive.

287
00:21:28,581 --> 00:21:29,481
Come on...

288
00:21:31,383 --> 00:21:32,783
You've done this before.
You can do it again.

289
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:24,823
Wolfsbane.

290
00:23:40,772 --> 00:23:41,538
Theo let you in.

291
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,476
Did you lie to me?

292
00:23:46,143 --> 00:23:47,810
I've never lied to you.

293
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:49,612
But you won't save her.

294
00:23:49,646 --> 00:23:51,481
I can't save her.

295
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:54,384
At least, not with a bite.

296
00:23:54,418 --> 00:23:56,619
If you'd just think about
that for a second, Liam,

297
00:23:56,653 --> 00:23:57,620
you would know that I'm right.

298
00:23:57,654 --> 00:23:59,455
I am thinking!

299
00:24:00,824 --> 00:24:04,159
I'm thinking about alternatives.

300
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:05,827
Liam, it's the Supermoon.

301
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,729
It's feeding your anger. It's
making you more aggressive.

302
00:24:07,764 --> 00:24:09,498
It's making me stronger!

303
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:12,467
You're gonna keep your promise.

304
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:14,503
Even if it kills you!

305
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,509
Oh, no, no, no, no...

306
00:24:24,913 --> 00:24:26,213
I think you better get Liam.

307
00:24:27,582 --> 00:24:29,750
What about Scott? He's not answering.

308
00:24:29,785 --> 00:24:32,520
And if Liam wants to be with
her, he needs to get here now.

309
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:34,187
Because she's dying,

310
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,089
and I don't know what else to do.

311
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:39,992
Go. I will text you if anything changes.

312
00:24:40,027 --> 00:24:41,461
Just get him here, Mason.

313
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:43,563
Go.

314
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,006
Hey, Liam, stop.

315
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,707
You're not going to save her by killing me

316
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:59,001
What the hell was that?

317
00:26:34,391 --> 00:26:35,825
I don't know what's going on around here,

318
00:26:35,859 --> 00:26:37,492
but I'm guessing things are bad again.

319
00:26:37,527 --> 00:26:38,560
Very.

320
00:26:38,594 --> 00:26:40,429
Then this is going to sound worse.

321
00:26:40,463 --> 00:26:41,931
'Cause your plan...

322
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:43,732
She knows. Yeah.

323
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:45,634
And she's coming.

324
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:48,603
The Desert Wolf knows you're alive.

325
00:26:48,638 --> 00:26:50,672
And she's coming back to Beacon Hills.

326
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:54,876
Come on, come on...

327
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:03,784
Sorry. I got here as fast as I could...

328
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:05,486
We gotta go. Now. Parrish
has got the bodies.

329
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,554
Okay, wait up... Stiles, wait.

330
00:27:06,588 --> 00:27:07,655
Parrish is out and he's got the bodies.

331
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:09,056
We've got to find Scott.
And we've got to tell him.

332
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:09,857
Stiles!

333
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:13,593
I don't think Scott wants
to talk to you right now.

334
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:14,828
Yeah, thanks, I'm aware of that.

335
00:27:14,863 --> 00:27:16,196
It doesn't matter. He
needs to know about this.

336
00:27:16,231 --> 00:27:17,464
Stiles...

337
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,934
Scott doesn't want to talk to you.

338
00:27:23,637 --> 00:27:25,372
But I think your dad does.

339
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,846
Don't do this, Liam!

340
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:14,919
I can't let you kill me.

341
00:28:40,543 --> 00:28:41,944
Your dad was looking for you, Stiles.

342
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,712
He found me instead.

343
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:46,982
Where is he?

344
00:28:48,517 --> 00:28:50,452
I covered for you.

345
00:28:50,486 --> 00:28:52,886
This was taken care of.

346
00:28:52,921 --> 00:28:54,888
If Melissa didn't find
it at the hospital...

347
00:28:54,923 --> 00:28:56,958
Guess even the son of
a cop can make mistakes.

348
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,393
Did you hurt him?

349
00:29:02,464 --> 00:29:05,099
I never lied about why
I came to Beacon Hills.

350
00:29:07,436 --> 00:29:08,668
I'm here for a pack.

351
00:29:10,204 --> 00:29:12,872
I came for the werecoyote.

352
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:16,076
The one whose first instinct is to kill.

353
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,811
I came for the Banshee, the
girl surrounded by death.

354
00:29:18,846 --> 00:29:20,646
I came for the dark Kitsune,

355
00:29:21,482 --> 00:29:22,482
the Beta with anger issues...

356
00:29:22,516 --> 00:29:24,317
I came for Void Stiles.

357
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,584
That's the pack I want.

358
00:29:27,787 --> 00:29:29,754
Unfortunately, it doesn't include Scott.

359
00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:34,893
Your heartbeat's rising, Stiles.

360
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:37,863
It's not because you're afraid.

361
00:29:38,431 --> 00:29:40,732
Nogitsune is gone,

362
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:43,067
but you've still got more blood
on your hands than any of us.

363
00:29:44,303 --> 00:29:45,603
I'm about to get more.

364
00:30:13,498 --> 00:30:15,465
I'll tell you where your dad is,

365
00:30:16,766 --> 00:30:18,534
if you promise not to help Scott.

366
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:23,805
There he is!

367
00:30:24,674 --> 00:30:26,375
That's Void Stiles.

368
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,776
It felt good, didn't it?

369
00:30:37,286 --> 00:30:38,653
We won't tell Scott.

370
00:30:40,022 --> 00:30:42,657
'Cause you can't lose
your best friend, right?

371
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:44,492
Even though we both know,
you never needed him.

372
00:30:48,164 --> 00:30:50,230
You hate me now, but
you'll get it eventually.

373
00:30:51,499 --> 00:30:53,300
This is the hard part.

374
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:56,136
'Cause you can't help Scott
and save your dad's life.

375
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,074
You've still got time, Stiles.

376
00:31:01,543 --> 00:31:02,842
You've still got time.

377
00:31:20,527 --> 00:31:21,827
He's using you, Liam.

378
00:31:23,097 --> 00:31:25,029
He wants you to be the Alpha

379
00:31:25,064 --> 00:31:27,399
because he can't take the power from me.

380
00:31:27,433 --> 00:31:28,600
Only you can.

381
00:31:30,269 --> 00:31:31,636
But once you do,

382
00:31:31,670 --> 00:31:33,838
he'll take it from you.

383
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:35,907
That's why he wants you to kill me...

384
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:37,275
That's what you don't get, Scott.

385
00:31:38,211 --> 00:31:39,711
I want to kill you.

386
00:31:40,346 --> 00:31:41,545
I want to!

387
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:44,772
Liam!

388
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,441
Liam!

389
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:48,609
Liam!

390
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,477
Liam!

391
00:32:57,151 --> 00:32:58,585
Liam, what are you doing?

392
00:33:04,492 --> 00:33:06,025
Hayden.

393
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:06,958
She's gone.

394
00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:10,962
Hayden died a few minutes ago.

395
00:33:12,432 --> 00:33:13,299
She's gone.

396
00:33:38,804 --> 00:33:40,405
Scott...

397
00:33:40,873 --> 00:33:42,507
What happened?

398
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:44,209
It's the Supermoon.

399
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:46,511
- It was just...
- Bad timing.

400
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:49,213
I mean, seriously. You couldn't
have waited five minutes?

401
00:33:52,917 --> 00:33:54,218
I should've stayed.

402
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:57,288
I should've made sure.

403
00:33:57,322 --> 00:33:59,823
Because now you have to kill me yourself.

404
00:33:59,857 --> 00:34:01,225
They're still mine.

405
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:03,527
Maybe not yet, but they'll come around.

406
00:34:03,562 --> 00:34:04,428
Not for you.

407
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:12,435
They're not like you.

408
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,471
They never will be.

409
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:17,507
Because I'm a Chimera?

410
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,544
Because I'm not a real werewolf?

411
00:34:23,013 --> 00:34:25,013
Because you're barely even human.

412
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:58,968
Scott! Scott!

413
00:36:03,007 --> 00:36:04,508
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

414
00:36:06,643 --> 00:36:07,610
Okay.

415
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:11,514
What...

416
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:13,882
One, two, three, four,
five... What are you doing?

417
00:36:13,917 --> 00:36:15,818
Six, seven, eight...

418
00:36:15,852 --> 00:36:16,852
What are you doing?

419
00:36:16,886 --> 00:36:18,187
Bringing him back.

420
00:36:18,221 --> 00:36:19,588
But his... His heart. He...

421
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:23,191
He hasn't had a pulse in over 15 minutes.

422
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:25,794
You can't bring someone back that's...

423
00:36:25,828 --> 00:36:27,662
He's not someone. He's my son.

424
00:36:27,697 --> 00:36:28,863
And he's an Alpha.

425
00:36:28,897 --> 00:36:30,865
And he's too strong to die like this!

426
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:32,467
Come on!

427
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:34,268
Open your eyes and look at me, okay?

428
00:36:34,303 --> 00:36:36,438
Come on. Breathe, baby. Breathe.

429
00:36:40,241 --> 00:36:42,776
Melissa, it's... Shut up!

430
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:44,277
He's too strong to die like this.

431
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:48,615
Come on. You can do this. You're an Alpha.

432
00:36:50,017 --> 00:36:51,385
You're an Alpha.

433
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:55,021
Come on, Scott. Roar.

434
00:36:55,957 --> 00:36:57,156
Come on!

435
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,525
Come on, Scott. Roar!

436
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,385
I've never done this before, Lydia.

437
00:37:26,419 --> 00:37:27,786
I know how dangerous it is.

438
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,421
But it's a risk we have
to take. No, no, don't!

439
00:37:32,624 --> 00:37:34,124
What do you think, Lydia?

440
00:37:34,158 --> 00:37:35,659
Am I doing it right?

441
00:37:38,963 --> 00:37:40,097
Yes, I see it...

442
00:37:42,501 --> 00:37:43,434
I can see it.

443
00:38:05,522 --> 00:38:06,722
I lost, Mom.

444
00:38:10,092 --> 00:38:11,693
Every leader suffers loss.

445
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,131
Sometimes more than you think is bearable.

446
00:38:17,233 --> 00:38:18,801
But this time, I lost everyone.

447
00:38:21,103 --> 00:38:22,603
You'll get them back.

448
00:38:22,638 --> 00:38:23,704
You have to.

449
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:27,742
Why would they come back?

450
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:32,580
Because you're their leader.

451
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:35,115
And even when a leader thinks
they have nothing left to give,

452
00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:37,652
there's still one thing.

453
00:38:43,023 --> 00:38:44,157
Hope.

454
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:47,126
Give them hope.

455
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,698
Come on, Lydia.

456
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,800
Come on.

457
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,674
Watch this, Lydia.

458
00:39:05,445 --> 00:39:06,846
You think you lost your mind?

459
00:39:08,281 --> 00:39:09,247
Well, watch this!

460
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:52,788
What... What's happening?

461
00:39:53,223 --> 00:39:54,724
Who are you?

462
00:39:54,758 --> 00:39:55,892
I'm your Alpha.

463
00:39:57,394 --> 00:39:58,661
And all of you...

464
00:40:00,196 --> 00:40:01,831
All of you belong to me.

465
00:40:42,102 --> 00:40:43,603
<i>La Bete.</i>

466
00:40:46,073 --> 00:40:47,607
<i>La Bete.</i>

467
00:40:48,909 --> 00:40:49,943
<i>La Bete.</i>

468
00:40:51,211 --> 00:40:52,445
<i>La Bete...</i>

469
00:40:54,448 --> 00:40:55,847
Success.

470
00:40:57,164 --> 00:41:02,357
