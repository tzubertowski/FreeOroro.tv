- You mean like Vivaldi?
- No, Frasier.

Hmm.

Please be kind to us,

I like what you got!
Good job!

00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:53,159
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

166
00:06:53,245 --> 00:06:54,210
We did it!

167
00:06:56,164 --> 00:06:57,797
What do you know?
He was right!

168
00:06:57,832 --> 00:07:00,083
- Hooray Principal Vagina!
- Yeah, I'll take it.

169
00:07:00,168 --> 00:07:03,169
Now, hold on a second!
Let's be rational about this.

170
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:05,889
No, I'm--
I'm just saying,

171

we don't know there's

Oh, my God!

♪

175
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:21,054
What the hell happened?

176
00:07:21,122 --> 00:07:22,989
Mr. President,
you're gonna want to see this.

177
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:25,224
I think planet Earth
has just been transported.

178
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:27,961
The head
has left and sent its children.

179
00:07:28,063 --> 00:07:29,746
Holy crap!

180
00:07:29,831 --> 00:07:32,699
Oh, dear giant head,
we apologize for that discussion.

181
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:34,450
It will never happen again.

182
00:07:34,536 --> 00:07:36,202
Oh, dear--
Oh, dear giant head...

183
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:40,006
Sir, we started picking up on
a garbled signal.

184
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,207
We're decrypting it now.

185
00:07:42,844 --> 00:07:47,280
<i>We asked them to show us
what they got, and they did.</i>

186
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:50,300
<i>Now we'll see which of them
has got the most.</i>

187
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:54,854
<i>24 hours, 5 planets, 5 songs.</i>

188
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:57,307
<i>But in the end,
there can only be one...</i>

189
00:07:57,392 --> 00:07:59,275
<i>Planet music!</i>

190
00:07:59,361 --> 00:08:00,893
<i>All participation is involuntary.</i>

191
00:08:00,946 --> 00:08:04,230
<i>Disqualified and losing planets
are disintegrated by plasma ray.</i>

192
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:06,065
Uh, it's probably a bad time
to mention it,

193
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:09,319
but any astronauts you guys had
in orbit are definitely dead.

194
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:13,131
Welcome back to "Planet Music"!

195
00:08:13,216 --> 00:08:14,883
First up,
let's hear the latest song

196
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:18,303
from planet Parblesnops',
The Greeby Bobes!

197
00:08:18,388 --> 00:08:20,054
Show me what you got!

198
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:22,257
Hold it, hold it.
Stop.

199
00:08:22,342 --> 00:08:24,809
Music isn't about
competition or captivity.

200
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:26,978
If you love music,
you love freedom.

201
00:08:27,063 --> 00:08:29,898
Let these worlds be free!
Please!

202
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,683
Disqualified.

203
00:08:34,771 --> 00:08:37,188
There's one every season.

204
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:40,275
Moving on to
planet Arboles Mentirosos.

205
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,946
Arbolian Mentirososians,
show us what you got!

206
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:46,698
A 2, 3, 4!

207
00:08:58,128 --> 00:09:00,345
Rick, Morty, Ice-T,
the timetable's moved up.

208
00:09:00,463 --> 00:09:01,963
Earth's on in six hours.

209
00:09:02,098 --> 00:09:04,182
Like we're not already
under enough pressure?!

210
00:09:04,301 --> 00:09:06,134
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Yeah!

211
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:09,187
Geez, Morty, the guy's just
doing his job. Take it easy.

212
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:12,140
Rick, Ice-T, could you guys
take it less easy?!

213
00:09:12,192 --> 00:09:14,192
We've got six hours
to come up with a song!

214
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,977
Genius happens in
the moment, Morty.

215
00:09:16,062 --> 00:09:17,645
Well, can we at least
go get our family?

216
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:18,863
You know, so we can take them--

217
00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:20,365
With u--
With us if we lose?

218
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,983
That's planning for failure,
Morty.

219
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:23,401
Even dumber
than regular planning.

220
00:09:23,486 --> 00:09:24,736
Balls.

221
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:26,204
Morty, Morty, stop.
Listen.

222
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:27,872
There's only so much charge
left in this thing.

223
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,657
If we portal home
from here and back,

224
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:31,626
we're not gonna have enough
charge left to get off world.

225
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:32,710
- Get it?
- What?!

226
00:09:32,796 --> 00:09:33,995
- Yeah.
- You see?

227
00:09:34,047 --> 00:09:36,631
I try to shelter you from certain
realities, Morty,

228
00:09:36,716 --> 00:09:38,082
because if I let you
make me nervous,

229
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:39,717
then we can't get schwifty.

230
00:09:39,836 --> 00:09:41,886
Stop saying it like it's a thing!
You made it up!

231
00:09:42,005 --> 00:09:43,388
Hey, Morty, could you lick my...

232
00:09:43,473 --> 00:09:44,923
<i>Balls, balls...</i>

233
00:09:45,008 --> 00:09:46,674
Rick, cut it out!
It's not funny, Rick!

234
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,344
I've seen enough.
These guys are one-hit wonders.

235
00:09:49,479 --> 00:09:50,762
And what's your plan, general?

236
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,127
We still have
the nuclear option.

237
00:09:52,182 --> 00:09:54,232
On my word,
we can launch a missile

238
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:56,434
at every one
of those heads in the sky.

239
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,820
Our planet's held captive
on a live game show,

240
00:09:58,855 --> 00:10:00,405
and your solution
is to shoot the audience?

241
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:02,690
You can put your faith in nukes
if we get through this, general.

242
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:05,410
Until then, I'll put mine
in Rick and Morty.

243
00:10:05,495 --> 00:10:07,996
"Get Schwifty" was a jam.

244
00:10:08,081 --> 00:10:10,081
Hello?
Yes, sir, yeah.

245
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,699
Eh, thank you, sir.
Thank you.

246
00:10:11,785 --> 00:10:14,118
He says he's proud
of what we're doing

247
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:17,839
and hopes we have
a great ascension festival!

248
00:10:17,924 --> 00:10:20,174
- Happy ascension!
- Happy ascension!

249
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,126
We should pack up
and leave town now.

250
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:24,929
I think it's inspiring that our
community is coping with fear

251
00:10:25,048 --> 00:10:27,382
in a way that involves a
festival and homemade ice cream.

252
00:10:27,434 --> 00:10:29,767
If you'd stop being
such an Evangelical atheist,

253
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:31,686
you might
start enjoying yourself.

254
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:33,271
Whoa!
Look at you!

255
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:34,889
You're wearing the hat
and everything!

256
00:10:34,975 --> 00:10:36,224
Here's yours!

257
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:38,393
Mom, do you mind
if I cook dinner tonight?

258
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:40,395
Yeah, sure.
Wait. What?

259
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,231
I love you guys.
You gave me life.

260
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:44,899
And it's the will
of the many heads

261
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:47,068
that all children
honor their parents.

262
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,403
Dinner sounds nice.

263
00:10:48,488 --> 00:10:49,904
Pardon, Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

264
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,906
Summer, are you
coming to the ascension?

265
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,242
Father, can we please
go to the ascension?

266
00:10:54,294 --> 00:10:56,077
Sure!
Let's go to the ascension.

267
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:57,328
Wh-wh-what is it?

268
00:10:57,414 --> 00:10:59,464
We hereby send these
unwantables skyward

269
00:10:59,549 --> 00:11:02,116
that they might be inhaled
by the many heads,

270
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:05,286
later to be sneezed back to us
as better babies.

271
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:07,488
Headward, free now to rise.

272
00:11:07,557 --> 00:11:09,490
Headward, free now to rise.

273
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,975
Headward, free now to rise.

274
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:13,761
Oh, yes! Yes!
Rise to the giant head!

275
00:11:13,813 --> 00:11:15,396
You are free to be free!

276
00:11:15,432 --> 00:11:17,432
And squeegee comes up
from the garage, right?

277
00:11:17,517 --> 00:11:19,150
But he's got a lobster
in one hand,

278
00:11:19,235 --> 00:11:21,395
the movie tickets in the other,
he's like, "I'm ready!"

279
00:11:22,522 --> 00:11:24,188
You gonna take a lobster
to see "Iron Man 3"?

280
00:11:24,274 --> 00:11:26,157
Ice-T!

281
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:27,408
Ah, damn.

282
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:29,444
We're out of
original-flavor fig Newtons.

283
00:11:29,529 --> 00:11:30,912
I should get going anyway.

284
00:11:30,947 --> 00:11:32,163
Wait, wait, wait!
C-come on.

285
00:11:32,282 --> 00:11:34,282
H-hold on a second.
Hold on.

286
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:38,002
- What?!
- Damn.

287
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:40,171
You didn't tell me you [bleep]
around with portals and shit.

288
00:11:40,256 --> 00:11:41,372
That's it!

289
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,840
Whoa, whoa, Morty!
Give me that.

290
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:44,008
You lied!
You lied about the charge!

291
00:11:44,127 --> 00:11:45,460
You were just being lazy!

292
00:11:45,512 --> 00:11:46,511
Get back!
Sit down!

293
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:47,879
Morty, just put it down.

294
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:49,263
You don't know
what you're doing.

295
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:51,049
I'm going to go
find mom and dad!

296
00:11:51,134 --> 00:11:52,050
No!

297
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:53,051
Oh [bleep]!

298
00:11:53,136 --> 00:11:54,519
Oh [bleep].

299
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:57,305
♪

300
00:12:06,316 --> 00:12:08,016
Oh [bleep].

301
00:12:08,084 --> 00:12:09,951
And then Ethan played guitar,
and we learned

302
00:12:10,036 --> 00:12:12,537
the seven contemplations
of the head by singing them.

303
00:12:12,622 --> 00:12:14,489
It was really fun.

304
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,907
Praise be the head!

305
00:12:15,992 --> 00:12:18,209
Praise be the...
Yeah.

306
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:20,161
Hi, folks.
Head Priest Vagina.

307
00:12:20,213 --> 00:12:22,046
Thanks for farming
all those potatoes.

308
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,612
It's 6:00 P.M.,
so if you're a parent,

309
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:26,300
you're now entitled to
adoration from your children.

310
00:12:26,336 --> 00:12:27,969
I'm going to start dinner!

311
00:12:28,004 --> 00:12:31,255
I don't know what to say.
Summer is doing really well here.

312
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:34,142
She's aced every test
in potato class,

313
00:12:34,177 --> 00:12:36,260
and look how important

314
00:12:36,346 --> 00:12:40,064
She's not getting pregnant or
doing drugs or missing curfew.

315
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,183
Please help me.
You can reach me if you try.

316
00:12:42,235 --> 00:12:43,601
Please help me!

317
00:12:43,686 --> 00:12:45,853
That's not our business
as long as Summer is thriving.

318
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:47,572
Taco time!

319
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:50,024
I hope it pleases you
as the head desires.

320
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,609
That's wonderful, Summer.

321
00:12:51,694 --> 00:12:53,327
We're so proud of you.

322
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:55,913
But obviously you don't have to
make dinner every night.

323
00:12:55,999 --> 00:12:58,332
Of course I do, silly!

324
00:12:58,368 --> 00:13:01,285
Oh, my God, daddy!
I'm sorry I called you silly!

325
00:13:01,371 --> 00:13:02,954
I'm so sorry!

326
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,422
Heavenly heads
and cranial creator,

327
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,041
forgive my transgressions
against family and community.

328
00:13:07,127 --> 00:13:09,944
May my chores complete me

330
00:13:24,394 --> 00:13:26,611
- Morty.
- Birdperson?

331
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:28,062
You appear to be dying.

332
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:31,032
I will make efforts to prevent
this but can promise nothing.

333
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,240
Wh-what do you think, ice?
Probably a little overdeveloped.

334
00:13:39,325 --> 00:13:42,126
Shit, overdeveloped,
underdeveloped--

335
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:43,578
A bad song's a bad song.

336
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,079
Well, do you think, maybe--

337
00:13:45,165 --> 00:13:46,297
Could you give me
some help with it, or...?

338
00:13:46,382 --> 00:13:47,582
Aw, hell no, man.

339
00:13:47,717 --> 00:13:49,584
You do your thing,
but I can't afford to

340
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:51,085
get my pride wrapped up
in your shame.

341
00:13:51,137 --> 00:13:52,503
You know what I'm saying?

342
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:54,422
Ice, I don't want to be
a negative Nelly or anything,

343
00:13:54,507 --> 00:13:56,474
but if Morty doesn't
come back with my portal gun

344
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:58,009
and I eat it out there,

345
00:13:58,094 --> 00:13:59,927
it's, uh, you know,
kind of your problem, too.

346
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:02,930
Pfft! I ain't worried about
no earth blowing up, man.

347
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:04,232
What?
Why not?

348
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:07,101
Yo, this is why.

349
00:14:07,237 --> 00:14:09,270
What the [bleep]
you can turn into ice?

350
00:14:09,355 --> 00:14:11,606
My story begins
at the dawn of time

351
00:14:11,658 --> 00:14:14,242
in the faraway realm
of alphabetrium.

352
00:14:14,277 --> 00:14:17,328
There, every being
is a letter of the alphabet.

353
00:14:17,413 --> 00:14:21,449
But I was frozen and exiled
to the cosmos by my elders

354
00:14:21,501 --> 00:14:24,535
as punishment for not
caring enough about anything.

355
00:14:24,621 --> 00:14:26,587
Earth is just
one of my many stops

356
00:14:26,623 --> 00:14:29,373
on a lifelong journey
with no destination.

357
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:32,093
So you better believe
I don't care if it blows up,

358
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:35,179
because I'll just be
ice floating through space,

359
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:36,964
like a comet.

360
00:14:37,016 --> 00:14:39,056
Take it from me, ice,
you can't just

361
00:14:39,135 --> 00:14:41,469
float around space
not caring about stuff forever.

362
00:14:41,521 --> 00:14:43,304
Pfft.
Man, watch me.

363
00:14:43,356 --> 00:14:44,972
Good luck, Rick.

364
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:50,394
Okay, things are getting
out of hand.

365
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,314
I better make sure Rick has
everything he needs to get schwifty.

366
00:14:53,366 --> 00:14:55,199
Oh, for God's sakes.
That's enough.

367
00:14:55,285 --> 00:14:56,651
What the hell are
you doing, Nathan?!

368
00:14:56,736 --> 00:14:59,153
I'm the goddamn president
of the United [bleep] States!

369
00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:00,705
I'm setting the nuclear
option to launch

370
00:15:00,823 --> 00:15:02,707
one minute
into earth's performance.

371
00:15:02,792 --> 00:15:05,459
And you, Mr. President...

372
00:15:05,545 --> 00:15:08,546
I hope you like being
hit in the face with a gun.

373
00:15:08,631 --> 00:15:11,415
Wait, wait, wait.
Why-- why--

374
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:15,670
I believe I can access
the history of Rick's gun

375
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:17,138
and help you get back to him.

376
00:15:17,223 --> 00:15:18,339
But can you help me
get to my family?

377
00:15:18,424 --> 00:15:19,590
You know, at-- at my house?

378
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:23,177
Is your intention to abandon Rick
using his own portal gun?

379
00:15:23,263 --> 00:15:26,013
In bird culture,
this is considered a dick move.

380
00:15:26,065 --> 00:15:28,015
All of Rick's moves
are dick moves!

381
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:29,233
What--
What am I eating?

382
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:30,768
Wh-what is this,
bird-- birdseed?

383
00:15:30,853 --> 00:15:33,271
It is random debris.
I found it in my carpet.

384
00:15:33,356 --> 00:15:34,772
I don't know what humans eat.

385
00:15:34,857 --> 00:15:37,525
- You know what this human eats.
- Don't be gross, Tammy.

386
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,076
Bird [bleep].

387

Tammy, gross.

388
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:42,363
Birdperson,
you always stick up for Rick,

389
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:44,448
but he doesn't care about
anyone but himself.

390
00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:47,368
He doesn't think about the
consequences of anything he does.

391
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:51,289
And as a result, he has the power
to save or destroy entire worlds.

392
00:15:51,374 --> 00:15:53,591
And he is the reason
you and I know each other...

393
00:15:53,676 --> 00:15:56,377
And the reason I'm alive at all.

- The world?
- Headism is a hit.

410

We've been waiting 16 years

not this person she's become.
